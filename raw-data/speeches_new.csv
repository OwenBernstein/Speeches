Donald Trump,2016," AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, DC","Good evening. Thank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I'm a newcomer to politics, but not to backing the Jewish state.In 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly, the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane, because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.In spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel, and frankly, for anyone supporting Israel. Many people turned down this honor; I did not. I took the risk and I'm glad I did.But I didn't come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That's what politicians do, all talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother, the only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.Thank you. My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. Thank you. I have been in business a long time, I know deal making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East.The problem here is fundamental. We've rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return. I've studied this issue in great detail. I would say, actually, greater by far than anybody else, believe me, oh, believe me.And it's a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.The deal doesn't even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years, but when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel.When I'm president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region.Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I'm not elected president, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that's why I'm going to be elected president, folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that, please.Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally, every day Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states, Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I'll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have.Now they're in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank, they're openly offering Palestinians 7,000 dollars per terror attack and 30,000 dollars for every Palestinian terrorist home that's been destroyed, a deplorable, deplorable situation.Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran's global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us.Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They've got terror cells everywhere, including in the Western Hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract enforced before, folks, believe me.Iran has already, since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. Those ballistic missiles, with a range of 1,250 miles, were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe and someday maybe hit even the United States and we're not going to let that happen, we're not letting it happen and we're not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.Thank you. Do you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi were the words ""Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth."" You can forget that.What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And here's another. You talk about twisted, here's another twisted part. Testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we've made. The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, I promise, we will.Thank you. Which brings me to my next point, the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it's not a friend to freedom, it's not a friend even to the United States of America; whereas you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to Israel.With President Obama, in his final year, yay, he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me, believe me, and you know it better than anybody. So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear, an agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster.The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president 100 percent.When people ask why, it's because that's not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together, they come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something, its values. I mean, we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires. That's what a deal is.A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That's not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It's not going to happen, folks.And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they're stabbing Israelis and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenal young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don't reward behavior like that. You cannot do it. There's only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it.So it's not up to the United Nations to really go with a solution. It's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. They have no choice, they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It's so preposterous. We're not going to let that happen.When I'm president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent.You see, I know about deal making, that's what I do. I wrote the Art of the Deal. One of the bestselling all-time, and I mean, seriously, I'm saying ""one of,"" because I'll be criticized if I say ""the,"" so I'm going to be very diplomatic, ""one of,"" I'll be criticized, I think it isnumber one, but why take a chance. One of the all-time bestselling books about deals and deal making.To make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying.That's right. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous; Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer; the Palestinian Authority rejected it also.Then John Kerry tried to come up with the framework and Abbas didn't even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn't even respond. When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one.Thank you. And when I say something, I mean it.I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we'll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. Meanwhile, every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and to hate the Jews. It has to stop.When you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can't let this continue. We can't let this happen any longer.You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible way to think. It's a barrier that can't be broken. That will end and it'll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you've got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace, they've got to go out and they've got to start [sic] this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it and now.There is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies.And you see that happening all the time, that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is a total disaster, by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.But it's repeated itself over and over again and it's done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn't happen.President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it's precisely the opposite that happens. Already half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half. So it's a very difficult situation that's never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We'll get it solved one way or the other. We will get it solved.But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That's what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States.We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel.The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that.And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state.I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I've been with Israel so long in terms of I've received some of my greatest honors from Israel; my father before me, incredible. My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact, it could be happening right now, which would be very nice as far as I'm concerned.So I want to thank you very much, this has been a truly great honor. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much."
Donald Trump,2016,"National Press Club in Washington, DC","Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for the National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. I would like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country – one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace. It is time to shake the rust off of America's foreign policy. It's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people, and American security, above all else. That will be the foundation of every decision that I will make. America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly look back. We have a lot to be proud of. In the 1940s we saved the world. The Greatest Generation beat back the Nazis and the Japanese Imperialists. Then we saved the world again, this time from totalitarian Communism. The Cold War lasted for decades, but we won. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan when he said: ""tear down this wall."" History will not forget what we did. Unfortunately, after the Cold War, our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, and this led to one foreign policy disaster after another. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos, and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. It all began with the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy. We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism; thousands of American lives, and many trillions of dollars, were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill the void, much to their unjust enrichment. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy. Today, I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy. First, Our Resources Are Overextended President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He's crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year. We're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us the resources we need to rebuild our military and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the Presidency who understands this problem and knows how to fix it. Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share. Our allies must contribute toward the financial, political and human costs of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so. They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries, besides America, are spending the minimum required 2% of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time – on planes, missiles, ships, equipment – building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense – and, if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump Administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded. Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can't depend on us. We've had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms, even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon and, under a Trump Administration, will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran's treatment of our ten captured sailors. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table. When the other side knows you're not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. President Obama gutted our missile defense program, then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel – and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place. Israel, our great friend and the one true Democracy in the Middle East, has been snubbed and criticized by an Administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel – a force for justice and peace – for acting as an impediment to peace in the region. President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power in the Middle East – all at the expense of Israel, our other allies in the region and, critically, the United States. We've picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help. Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they are just as confused as our allies, but an even bigger problem is that they don't take us seriously any more. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there to meet or greet him – perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then, amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia -- it's called no respect. Do you remember when the President made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark to get the Olympics for our country, and, after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth place? He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. The list of humiliations goes on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands even further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade rules – or apply the leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engage in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We've let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything. If President Obama's goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job. Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals.  Since the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the Soviet Union, we've lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day we're bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians, the next day we are watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls apart. We're a humanitarian nation. But the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion, and disarray. We have made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS. And we're in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won't even name the enemy! Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words ""radical Islam,"" even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees. After Secretary Clinton's failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep! Incredible. Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie. Our Ambassador was murdered and our Secretary of State misled the nation – and by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o'clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil. This will change when I am president. To all our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be a reliable friend and ally again. We're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests, and the shared interests of our allies. We are getting out of the nation-building business, and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge. We need a new, rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, as well as by our close allies. This is how we won the Cold War, and it's how we will win our new and future struggles. First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam.  Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States. Events may require the use of military force. But it's also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War. In this we're going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence. We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street – they must also be good to us and remember us and all we are doing for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or worse -- all you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th. And then there's ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. We must as, a nation, be more unpredictable. But they're going to be gone. And soon. Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy.  The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look what's happened to us! Our nuclear weapons arsenal – our ultimate deterrent – has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during that time. The Air Force is about 1/3 smaller than 1991. Pilots are flying B-52s in combat missions today which are older than most people in this room. And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that, in real dollars, cuts nearly 25% from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted, and we're asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming. We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned. But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, not one dollar can be wasted. We are also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again – and to put Americans first again. This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenue and increase our economic might as a nation. We need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority gives us an edge. This includes 3-D printing, artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute. A Trump Administration will give our service men and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve, and the best care in the world when they return as veterans to civilian life. Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests.Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were attacked and seventeen brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole. And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China to the World Trade Organization – which has been a disaster for the United States – than into stopping Al Qaeda. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama Bin Laden, and didn't do it. And then, we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America's core national security interests, and the following will be my priorities. In the Middle East, our goals must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear-sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are our friends. We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes. But we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests. Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia – from a position of strength – is possible. Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end. Some say the Russians won't be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can't make a good deal for America, then we will quickly walk from the table. Fixing our relations with China is another important step towards a prosperous century. China respects strength, and by letting them take advantage of us economically, we have lost all of their respect. We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit we must find a way, quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. After I am elected President, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies, and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO's outdated mission and structure – grown out of the Cold War – to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism. I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must fight to win. I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary – and will only do so if we have a plan for victory. Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we've had the exact opposite: a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy – one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wake. After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worse shape now in the Middle East than ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama-Clinton – it has been a complete and total disaster. I will also be prepared to deploy America's economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very persuasive – but we need to use them selectively and with determination. Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce it. However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the War in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary was Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their rich oil reserves – something it has wanted to do for decades. And now, to top it all off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That is why I will also look for talented experts with new approaches, and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread ""universal values"" that not everyone shares, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions. These are my goals, as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, and which our friends and allies will respect and welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies. To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership again. Many Americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than their own. Americans must know that we are putting the American people first again. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy – the jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority. No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must do the same. We will no longer surrender this country, or its people, to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down, and will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs. NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the U.S. and has emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. Never again. Only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. Their will be consequences for companies that leave the U.S. only to exploit it later. Under a Trump Administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries. I will view the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America's greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are. The world is most peaceful, and most prosperous, when America is strongest. America will continually play the role of peacemaker. We will always help to save lives and, indeed, humanity itself. But to play that role, we must make America strong again. We must make America respected again. And we must make America great again. If we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever known. Thank you."
Donald Trump,2016,"Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire","Thank you for joining me today.This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history.So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.The horror is beyond description.The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.We mourn, as one people, for our nation's loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it.I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.[SILENCE]Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.This is a very dark moment in America's history.A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people – with force, purpose and determination.But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart – and fast – we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.It's not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans – women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.The male shooter in San Bernardino – again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.Yet, Hillary Clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words ""radical Islam,"" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.However, Hillary Clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is.She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: ""Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.""Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.In fact, Hillary Clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss – it's deadly.The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.I refuse to be politically correct.I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials – and with our allies.I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done.We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.These Departments refused to comply.President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.The public has a right to know how these people got here.We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?Truly, our President doesn't know what he is doing. He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.We can't let this happen.Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States – we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.We've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women, and murder gays.I don't want them in our country.The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us – is brought to justice.If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .America must do more – much more – to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.It also means we must change our foreign policy.The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.We've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.America will be a tolerant and open society.America will also be a safe society.We will protect our borders at home.We will defeat ISIS overseas.We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.We will make America rich again.We will make America safe again.We will make American Great Again.Thank you.The media talks about ""homegrown,"" terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views.She can't have it both ways. She can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values?Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities – all of our communities.America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged in many years.So whether it's matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are.I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.I want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens."
Donald Trump,2016,Trump SoHo in New York City,"Today I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.People have asked me why I am running for President.I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.We come to work together and turn visions into reality.We think big, and then we make it happen.I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton – only by me.The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.Because it's not just the political system that's rigged. It's the whole economy.It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.It's rigged against you, the American people.Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar –just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.Here is my promise to the American voter:If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests.Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.They totally own her, and that will never change.The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.Those are the stakes.Hillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.She believes she is entitled to the office.Her campaign slogan is ""I'm with her.""You know what my response to that is? I'm with you: the American people.She thinks it's all about her.I know it's all about you – I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what's good for America's middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.That's what we mean by America First.Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.Our Founders understood this.One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for ""the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]"" in America.Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:""The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.""I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day.Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.She gets rich making you poor.Here is a quote from the book: ""At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.""These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas – and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book – deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career – and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.It's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars – and unleashed ISIS across the world.No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.Here is what one of the victim's mothers had to say:""I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president.""In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.Libya was cooperating.Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.Syria was under control.Iran was being choked by sanctions.Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.ISIS wasn't even on the map.Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managedto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.Hillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen – while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality – and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.In short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:""She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true…Her leadership style – volcanic, impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else – hasn't changed a bit.""Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth – with no way to screen who they are or what they believe. Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access – even though he had no national security credentials.Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State – plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments – perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China – putting all of America in danger.Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.We can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.National security is also immigration security – and Hillary wants neither.Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter:""Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way – an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.""Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobsStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are manyCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseasLift restrictions on energy productionRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.There is one common theme in all of these reforms.It's going to be America First.This is why the stakes in November are so great.On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired. Her message is that can't change.My message is that things have to change – and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.Then we started thinking small.We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.But that's not who we are.Come this November, we can bring America back – bigger and better, and stronger than ever.We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth – the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment – we will bring it back all the way.Massive new factories will come roaring into our country – breathing life and hope into our communities.Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.Our country is going to start working again.People are going to start working again.Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again – including parents in our inner cities.Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.We are going to make America rich again.We are going to make America safe again.We are going to make America Great Again – and Great Again For EVERYONE."
Donald Trump,2016,"Virginia Beach, Virginia","Thank you.I'd like to thank Chairman Jeff Miller for his leadership on behalf of those who have served this country in military uniform, and for working with our campaign on developing real solutions for our great Veterans.Before going further today, however, I would first like to address the contributions of another group who serve this country in uniform: the men and women in blue.Our Police Officers rush into danger every day to protect our communities, and they often do it thanklessly and under relentless criticism.They save thousands of lives every year, perform countless public services every day, and yet their names will likely never appear in a single headline or media report.But I want our nation's police to know, that we thank you, and we support you, and we will always stand with you.The attack on our Dallas police is an attack on our country.Our whole nation is in mourning, and will be for a very long time.Yet, we've also seen increasing threats against our police and a substantial rise in the number of officers killed in the line of duty.America's police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos – and the destruction of our country as we know it.We must remember, the police are needed the most where crime is the highest. Politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable Americans.It is time for the hostility against our police, and against all members of law enforcement, to end – and to end right now.We went through an ugly chapter in our history, during Vietnam, when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas. For too many police today, that is their daily reality.At the same time, the tragic deaths in Louisiana and Minnesota make clear the work that must be done to ensure every American feels that their safety is protected. We were all disturbed by the images we saw.We must discuss, as well, the ongoing catastrophe of crime in our inner cities. According to the Chicago Tribune, there has already been more than 2,000 shooting victims in Chicago this year alone. This epidemic of violence destroys lives, destroys communities, and destroys opportunity for young Americans.Violent crime has increased in cities across America. The New York Times described ""a startling rise in murders,"" in our major cities.Brutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into Virginia and Maryland.Too many Americans are trapped in fear, violence and poverty.Our inner cities have been left behind, and I am going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home, safe school and safe community.We must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country.I am the law and order candidate.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is weak, ineffective, pandering, and, as proven by her recent email scandal, which was an embarrassment not only to her, but to the nation as a whole, she is either a liar or grossly incompetent.Personally, I think she is both.Not only am I the law and order candidate, but I am also the candidate of compassion. But you can't have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of the United States. Every kid in America should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood.Everyone will be protected equally and treated justly, without prejudice.We will be tough, we will be smart, we will be fair – and we will protect all Americans.Without safety, we have nothing!It is the job of the next President to Make America Safe Again — For Everyone.That promise of protection must include taking care of every last Veteran, which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the attack in Dallas.The men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of America.Now is the time to follow their example of unity, public service and selfless devotion to our country.We made a promise to these heroes. You defend America, and America will defend you.But that promise has been broken by our politicians, like so many other promises our country has made – not only to its veterans, but to its citizens as a whole.President Obama has allowed our Veterans Affairs health care system to deny help and support to those who deserve it most.Hillary Clinton recently said of the VA scandal that ""it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be.""She actually thinks that the Veterans Health Administration is well run – that's because she has been part of the rigged system.Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives – instead of spending time with real people in real pain.The disconnect in America is deep.There are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else.The VA scandals that have occurred on this Administration's watch are widespread and inexcusable.An internal memo from a senior VA official describes ""lawlessness and chaos,"" at the Veterans Health Administration, including the payments of $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules.The memo also says they ""waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws"" and warns that ""these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to America's Veterans.""Even the White House's own Deputy Chief of Staff described ""significant and chronic systemic failures,"" in Veterans Affairs, including ""a corrosive culture that has led to personnel problems across the Department,"" with ""poor management,"" and ""a history of retaliation toward employees raising issues."" He said there is a ""lack of accountability across all grade levels.""Here are just a few examples:--Forty veterans died waiting for care in Phoenix.--Forty different VA facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times.--A VA employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff, as was a convicted sex offender.--The VA spent $8 million on solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be torn down.--The St. Cloud, Minn. VA built a $2.3 million wind turbine in April 2011 that hasn't supplied power since 2012.Can you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full investigation in January of 2017?Most of those responsible have still not been held to account.Fixing this corruption will be one of my highest priorities – and it will happen. It will be fixed.That begins with a simple promise: every Veteran will get timely access to top-quality careVeterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center.We must extend this right to all Veterans– not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days, or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is the current policy.This promise includes guaranteed access to the best available healthcare services for our female Veterans.We must also do more to help our Veterans find jobsEvery year, large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas, and across the border, to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our Veterans.Veterans should come first in the country they fought to protect, and under a Trump Administration they will -- America First, Veterans First.Veterans' health care must also include the best mental health care.A shocking 20 Veterans are committing suicide each day, especially our older Veterans.This is a national tragedy.The evidence shows that if Veterans are in the system, receiving care, they are much less likely to take their own lives than Veterans outside the system.That is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the VA – while ensuring that Veterans can access private mental health care as well.America must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large. This includes expanding the number of facilities, integrating primary care and mental care professionals, reforming confinement rules, and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones the care they need – especially in emergencies.One of the most important reforms we can make is accountabilityRight now, when VA employees fail our Veterans, you can't discipline them.That's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform.In fact, employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions.In 2014, the VA awarded $142 million in bonuses to its employees, including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the Denver VA hospital that was more than $1 billion over budget.Two other VA executives even abused their authority to obtain $400,000 in relocation benefits.It doesn't have to be this way.As Veteran Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said: ""The VA is not sacred. The Veteran is.""Here is my 10 step plan to ensure quality, timely care for every Veteran in America:One:I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the VA.The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our Veterans – not bureaucrats, not politicians, but Veterans. Amazingly, President Obama's VA Secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at Disneyland.Two:I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail our Veterans or breach the public trust.Three:I am going to ask Congress to pass legislation that ensures the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health, safety or well-being of any Veteran.Four:I am going to appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for bold legislative reform.Five:I am going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the VA have their jobs protected, and are put in line for promotions.Six:I will create a private White House Hotline – that is answered by a real person 24 hours a day – to ensure that no valid complaint about VA wrongdoing falls through the cracks.I will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me, and I will pick up the phone and fix it myself, if need be.That's a promise.Seven:We are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money, and start giving bonuses to people for improving service, saving lives and cutting waste.If an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates better outcomes for our Veterans, then a small, responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to taxpayers.Eight:We are going to reform our visa programs to ensure American Veterans are in the front, not back, of the line.Nine:We are going to increase the number of mental health care professionals, and increase outreach to Veterans outside of the system.Ten:We are going to ensure every Veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the VA, or to seek private medical care paid for by our government.Never again will we allow a Veteran to suffer or die waiting for the care they so richly deserve.We need to clean out the corruption in Government, and Hillary Clinton will never be able to do itShe is incompetent, and has proven that time and time again.Crooked Hillary Clinton is the Secretary of the Status Quo – and wherever Hillary Clinton goes, corruption and scandal follow.Our country needs change, and she will never give us change.The fact is, she helped create our rigged system.Hillary Clinton's America is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment.The rigged system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of America at risk.Hillary Clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and to bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials.In other words, she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading her emails as long as the voting American public could not.Her conduct was willful, intentional, and unlawful – and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware of her guilt.This was not just extreme carelessness with classified material – which is still totally disqualifying. This is calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct – followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to Congress, the media and the American people.In fact, when the FBI interviewed her for only 3 hours during the 4th of July weekend, her interview was not recorded, and she was, amazingly, not even put under oath.She carried out her dangerous email scheme at the same time as her bad judgement and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing ISIS across the world.Afterwards, as a further demonstration of guilt, Hillary Clinton erased more than thirty thousand emails as part of the cover-up.The fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment.When thinking about her e-mail destruction, let's not forget: many foreign and corporate entities, and other special interests, with business before Hillary Clinton's State Department were making massive financial contributions. These contributions were made to both the Clinton Foundation and to the Clintons directly.If elected, Hillary Clinton would become the first President of the United States who wouldn't be able to pass a background check.Just look at what the FBI Director said about her – her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.Clearly, Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.The decades of decay, division and decline will come to an end.The years of American Greatness will return.We are going to become, for the first time in a long time, one united country.We are going to make American Great Again – And Safe Again – For All Americans.We will dream big and bold and daring things once more.Let me conclude by paying tribute to every single American hero who has served this country, and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.We are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for us.We will be a safe, strong, and proud country once again.Thank you."
Hilary Clinton,2016,Concession,"Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country. But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together, this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted. We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them. Now, and let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years but all the time. So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear; making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams. We've spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone -- for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone. So now, our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will. I am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate. To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. We thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world. And to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most -- even four-month-old Aidan who traveled with his mom. I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country. You poured your hearts into this campaign. For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted. And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret, private Facebook sites. I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward. To everyone who sent in contributions as small as five dollars and kept us going, thank you. Thank you from all of us. And to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes and I've had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too. This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it. It is worth it. And so we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives. And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. Now, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams. Finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American. And I still believe as deeply as I ever have that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us. Because, you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us, ""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart."" So my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do. I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America."
Joe Biden,2020,"Biden Speech Transcript on Primary Night, March 17","And I hope all of you are staying safe, talking and taking the recommended precautions and talking to the docs, if you have one, to keep your social distance, to slow the spread of this virus. This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives and every aspect of this campaign. Most of all, my heart goes out to all of those of you who’ve lost a loved one. To those who have contracted the virus. To all the brave Americans who are working harder than ever to help their neighbors and all those children that are home from school that are worried and don’t know quite why. Doctors, nurses, EMTs and public health officials, as well as the frontline emergency workers like firefighters and dedicated folks working to keep the shelves stocked in the grocery stores. You know, tackling this pandemic is a national emergency, akin to fighting a war and it’s going to require leadership and cooperation from every level of government. And it’s going to require us to move thoughtfully and decisively to quickly address both the public health crisis as well as the economic crisis. It’s going to require us to pay attention to the medical and scientific and health experts. And it’s going to require each of us to do our part. Yes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it’s also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact on what happens. Make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak and the ability of our medical hospital systems to handle it. You know, I know we as a people are up to this challenge, we always have been. I know that we’ll answer this moment of crisis with the best that we find in all of us because that’s what Americans always have done and what we do. That’s who we are, ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises. And today we’re moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge. Americans in three states went to the polls today. I want to thank all the public officials and the poll workers who work closely with the public health authorities to assure safe opportunities for voting, to clean and disinfect voting booths and to make sure the voters could cast their ballots while maintaining the distance from one another that was safe. You know, it’s important for us to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy. And today it looks like once again in Florida and Illinois, we’re still awaiting to hear from Arizona, our campaign has had a very good night. We moved closer to securing the Democratic Party’s nomination for president. And we’re doing it by building a broad coalition that we need to win in November. With strong support from the African American community, the Latino community, high school educated people like the folks I grew up with in my old neighborhood, labor, teachers, suburban women, veterans, firefighters, and so many more. And we’re doing it with a common vision. Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable healthcare for all Americans, reducing income inequity that has risen so drastically. To tackling the existential threat of our time, climate change. Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues and together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country. So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you, I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and then to unify the nation. You know, it’s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans. The coronavirus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power, as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We’re all in this together. This is a moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us. To look out for our neighbor, to understand the fear and stress that so many are feeling. To care for the elderly, the elderly couple down the street. To thank the healthcare worker, the doctors, the nurses, the pharmacists, the grocery store cashier, and the people restocking the shelves. To believe in one another. Because I assure you when we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we lift this nation up and we’ll get through this together. That’s how we’ve always done it. God bless you all. And my special prayer for those of you in the front lines of the crisis, doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, caring for the virus victims and their families, my prayers are going out for everyone. My hopes are high because I believe in times of crisis, Americans have always stepped up. We have to step up and care for one another. Thank you all. Thank you all for listening. Oh, thanks, thanks, thanks. Okay."
Bernie Sanders,2020,"Sanders Speech Transcript on Primary Night, March 17","I don’t have to tell anyone viewing this program that our country, and in fact the world of facing an unprecedented series of crises. We’re dealing with the coronavirus, which is spreading throughout this country and throughout the world. We’re dealing with a growing economic meltdown, which will impact tens of millions of workers in this country. We are dealing with a political crisis as well. And I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering, what is going to happen to me tomorrow in my own city? Burlington, Vermont, laws have been shut down. restaurants shutdown, showcase centers shut down, schools shutdown. What happens to all the people who lose their jobs? What happens to the people who tonight are worried that they may have the coronavirus but don’t have the resources to get the tests they need or the treatment that they need. So this is a moment that we have got to be working together and going forward together. And what I wanted to do tonight along with you is to talk about a series of proposals that we all working on right now and will introduce to the democratic leadership as to how we can best go forward. And in this unprecedented moment this will require an unprecedented amount of money and my own guess is that we’ll be spending at least $2 trillion in funding to prevent deaths, job losses, and to avoid an economic catastrophe. So let me just go over some of the issues and we’ll be posting these ideas tomorrow up on our website, berniesanders.com. And this is what I would like because we certainly don’t know it all we want to hear from you, not only your ideas about how we can best go forward, talk about your experiences. In every state there is a different level of crisis, in every occupation there is a different level of concern.

Bernie Sanders: (02:23)
So please communicate with us so we can get the best understanding possible about what’s going on in our country and how together we can come up with some effective remedies.

Bernie Sanders: (02:35)
Let me start off with the basics and that is obviously from my perspective and I know from all of your perspectives. We need to make certain that everybody in our country who needs to go to a doctor can get the healthcare they need regardless of their income. This is kind of a no-brainer. It’s something that should have happened in our country many, many years ago. But in the midst of this crisis, what I believe we must do is empower Medicare to cover all medical bills during this emergency.

Bernie Sanders: (03:10)
Now, this is not Medicare for all. We can’t pass that right now, but what this does say is that if you’re uninsured, if you are under insured, if you have high deductibles, if you have high copayments, if you have out of pocket expenses, Medicare will cover those expenses so that everybody, regardless of their healthcare needs, and I’m not just talking about the coronavirus, but their health care needs in the midst of this crisis, will get all the healthcare that they need. That is what we should be doing in this moment of crisis.

Bernie Sanders: (03:47)
We need to make sure furthermore, that as we go forward, we are effectively prepared to deal with the healthcare crisis that we’re facing and that means that we need to make sure that the hospitals have all of the ICU units and the ventilators that are needed to respond to this crisis. What the fear is as you know, is that there will be a surge of patients coming into the hospitals and that we will not have the equipment that we need to deal with that crisis.

Bernie Sanders: (04:19)
Now, in my view, I mean, frankly, it is incomprehensible why in the wealthiest country on earth, we are not better prepared, but be that as it may, in my view right now, the federal government must work aggressively with the private sector to make certain that this equipment is available to hospitals and the rest of the medical community. In other words, federal government must take the responsibility of working with the private sector and saying, you know what, this is a major priority. You’re going to get the job done.

Bernie Sanders: (04:51)
And during this crisis, in addition, of course, we need to mobilize medical residents, people in medical school, retired medical professionals and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis. One of the great fears that we are facing right now is that doctors themselves and nurses themselves will become ill. And if our frontline defense in the medical profession is injured, is made sick, is not able to treat the American people, that’s only going to make a very difficult situation even worse.

Bernie Sanders: (05:28)
Furthermore, and again, this goes without saying, it’s something that should have been done, It has to be done immediately. We must massively increase the availability of test kits, test kits for coronavirus and the speed at which the tests are processed. We must look to successful coronavirus testing models in other countries and throughout our own country and implement best practices here. And right now there are communities and states all over this country that do not have the test kits. It’s taking too long to get the results. We’ve got to aggressively address that.

Bernie Sanders: (06:07)
In my view, we need to use existing emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to dramatically scale up production in the United States of critical supplies such as masks, ventilators, and protective equipment that our healthcare workers need. It is again, quite unbelievable, but we have a short supply of masks, and if the doctors and nurses don’t have the masks that they need, it’s going to be very difficult for them to provide the care that patients require.

Bernie Sanders: (06:41)
We need to utilize the national guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to deal with this crisis. Today our armed forces must be immediately activated to build mobile hospitals and testing facilities, assist providers reopen hospitals that have been shut down and expand our healthcare capacity in underserved areas. One of the ongoing crisis is that our healthcare system faces in many parts of this country under the best of times, people can’t find a doctor or a hospital 200 miles away from them. That’s not acceptable and we have to address that reality in the midst of this crisis today.

Bernie Sanders: (07:25)
We need to dramatically expand community health centers, which provide primary care, dental care and mental health care, as well as low cost prescription drugs to nearly 30 million Americans, including some of the poorest and most vulnerable. We have a primary healthcare system which is in very, very bad shape. Even people who have insurance having a hard time in many cases finding the doctors that they need.

Bernie Sanders: (07:55)
So expanding community health centers will be a significant step forward in making sure that there are locations where people can get the testing they need, get the treatment that they need, get the healthcare that they need in general. And while we are making sure that all of our people have the healthcare that they need, we must also respond to the growing economic crisis that this pandemic is causing.

Bernie Sanders: (08:24)
That means that we must make sure that everyone who has a job right now receives the paychecks that they need and does not lose their income. As we speak right now, think about the millions of workers who are being laid off in the tourism industry, in the fast food industry, in the restaurant industry, in the transportation industry. These are folks who don’t have a lot of money as all of you know, some 40% of the people in this country cannot afford a $400 emergency. So people are sitting out there and they’re saying, “My God, what am I going to do? How do I take care of my families?” And that has got, got to be the major, major economic priority that we address. How do we take care of the working families of this country who are negatively impacted by this crisis?

Bernie Sanders: (09:17)
Small and medium size businesses, especially those in severely impacted industries such as restaurants, bars, and local retail need immediate relief. We must tell these businesses who are being forced to lay off, in some cases their entire staff or possibly even shut down through no fault of their own, that we will not allow them to go out of business. The federal government will work with affected businesses to provide direct payroll costs for small and medium-sized businesses to keep workers employed until this crisis has passed.

Bernie Sanders: (09:57)
In other words, bottom line here, most important point is workers need to continue to get a paycheck even when their businesses are shut down.

Bernie Sanders: (10:08)
Further, we need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in America every month for the duration of the crisis to provide them with the assistance they need to pay their bills and take care of their families. Now we’re throwing out a lot of ideas and when you deal with the United States Congress, you don’t get everything that you want. There will be picking and choosing here and there, but I think it’s important for us tonight to discuss the various options that they have. And one of those options is to make sure that people at least getting $2,000 a month check to take care of their basic needs.

Bernie Sanders: (10:48)
And importantly, we must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible. In other words, we don’t want some kind of bureaucratic arrangement. We were talking about this for weeks and months and people do not get the help that they need. We must provide emergency unemployment assistance to anyone who loses their job through no fault of their own. Under the proposal that I am working on, everyone who loses a job must qualify for unemployment compensation at 100% of their prior salary with a cap of $75,000 a year.

Bernie Sanders: (11:31)
In addition, those who depend on tips, waiters and waitresses and others, gig workers, domestic workers, freelancers, and independent contractors must also qualify for unemployment insurance to make up for the income that they lose during this crisis. I think as many of you know, unemployment compensation does not cover every worker in America. There are millions of people exempt from unemployment. We have got to deal with that right now. It doesn’t matter what work you’re doing. If you lose your job, you need unemployment.

Bernie Sanders: (12:03)
Further, we need to make certain that seem as people with disabilities and families with children have access to decent quality food. That means expanding the Meals on Wheels program, the school meals program and food stamps so that no one goes hungry during this crisis and everyone who cannot leave that home can receive nutritious meals delivered directly to where they live. In other words, that’s as basic as you can get in America during this crisis, people must not go hungry.

Bernie Sanders: (12:40)
We must place an immediate moratorium on evictions, on foreclosures and utility shutoffs and suspend payment on mortgage loans for primary residences and utility bills. In other words, it would be unacceptable that people could lose their homes, lose their apartments, see electricity or gas shutoffs during this crisis, so they must be a moratorium in those areas.

Bernie Sanders: (13:14)
Furthermore, we must restore utility services to any customers who have had the utilities shut off. Unbelievably in America right now, you’ve got a whole lot of folks who literally do not have running water in their homes because they haven’t been able to pay their water bill, they may not have electricity and that has got to be dealt with right now.

Bernie Sanders: (13:34)
We must also provide funding for states and localities to provide rental assistance for the duration of this crisis.

Bernie Sanders: (13:44)
In addition, we need to waive all student loan payments for the duration of the emergency. Longterm as I think all of you know, it is my view that we must cancel all student debt and make public colleges and universities and trade schools tuition free, and that is the view that I have held for a long time. But right now at the very least, we must make sure that nobody is obliged to pay their student loan right now.

Bernie Sanders: (14:17)
Furthermore, we must ensure that the homeless survivors of domestic violence and college students quarantined off campus are able to receive the shelter, the healthcare, and the nutrition they need and connect those individuals with social services to ensure nobody is left behind. We must also utilize empty hotel beds and other vacant properties to ensure that everyone in this country is safely housed during this crisis. We cannot forget that right now, tonight, there are some 500,000 people who are homeless, some in emergency shelters, some who are sleeping out on the street. Our job is to make sure that everyone is safely housed during this crisis.

Bernie Sanders: (15:06)
Further, we must protect farmers by suspending all farm service agency loan payments to protect farmers during this crisis, extend crop insurance and emergency loans to all affected farmers, extend rural development loans, and expand the emergency food assistance program to help alleviate hunger throughout the country and support our farmers during this crisis. We already have a major, major crisis in terms of family-based agriculture in America. Thousands and thousands of family farmers are losing their farms, we’ve got to stop that process right now during this emergency.

Bernie Sanders: (15:43)
Finally, we must make sure that our response to this health and economic crisis is not another moneymaking opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street. Let me underline that. We must make certain that this health and economic crisis is not another moneymaking opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street. We need to establish an oversight agency to ensure that no one is profiting off of the economic pain and suffering of our people in the midst of this crisis. Any emergency credit extensions or loans to insolvent companies or industries as a result of this crisis must come with strict protections and benefits for workers, for unions and for customers not no strings attached handouts for large corporations and their executives.

Bernie Sanders: (16:46)
During this crisis, we will ban stock buy backs and bonuses for executives. We will put conditions on this financial assistance to make certain that any corporation in America that benefits from emergency aid does not lay off workers, pays workers a livable wage and does not rip off consumers. We must make sure that companies they get bailouts are required to sell equity to the government and put workers on their board of directors.

Bernie Sanders: (17:22)
We need to prevent price gouging by pharmaceutical companies. As soon as coronavirus vaccine is developed, it must be sold for free. This is not an opportunity for some drug companies to make a fortune by charging an outrageous price for the medicine that people need in order to stay alive.

Bernie Sanders: (17:44)
Further all prescription drugs that are developed with taxpayer dollars must be sold at a reasonable price. The pharmaceutical industry must be told in no uncertain terms that the medicines that they manufacture for this crisis will be sold at cost. This is not the time for profiteering or price gouging.

Bernie Sanders: (18:09)
So we’ve covered a lot of territory tonight and this is what I would very much appreciate where I’d appreciate getting your help. Once again, this is an outline of proposals that I will be introducing to the Senate leadership and working with the Democratic leadership to implement. But it is important for me to hear your comments. We will have this outline up tomorrow in a little bit clearer way on our website, berniesanders.com. And in addition to that we need to know what you are experiencing right now. It’s hard to write proper legislation if we are not familiar with the kinds of pain and problems that people all across this country are facing.

Bernie Sanders: (18:59)
So let me just conclude by once again thanking all of you for being with us tonight to understand that what this country is experiencing right now is something that we have never experienced in the modern history of this country. That is, number one, a major pandemic, which threatens the health and lives of millions of our people. And on top of that, an economic crisis which threatens the jobs and the income of many, many, many millions of people.
So we got some major crises, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future. This is the richest country in the history of the world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources, we can do it. We can address this crisis. We can minimize the pain and let us do just that. So let us go forward together and I look forward to continuing to communicate with you, to tell you where we are coming from, what our ideas are, and look forward to hearing from you as to what your ideas are and what your situation is. So once again, thank you very much for joining us this evening. Good night."
Donald Trump,2020,North Carolina Rally,"I want to thank you very much. North Carolina, thank you very much. I’m thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte, where, by the way, we’re having our convention. I guess you heard that, right? With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now, we’re going to defeat the radical socialists. We’re going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide. We won it last time, we’re going to win it this time by even more. And you know, Eric and Lara named their daughter, you know what her name is? Carolina, Carolina. Her name is Carolina for a reason. This is an incredible time for our nation. Our country is stronger than ever before. And today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. That’s great. That’s great. That was great. You know, our opponents were saying, ” Oh, maybe he’s in trouble, maybe the economy … ” They’ll do anything. They’ll do anything. I’m sure they were thrilled. Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today? I don’t think so. By the way, look at this. Look back there, look at all of that press. Look at all them. Man, I don’t know if Sleepy Joe, or Bernie, I don’t think they have that much press. Bernie was going wild. Why would I be here tonight? Why would I be here? He said why would I be here tonight? We don’t have the primary, we’ve already won the thing, you know? I was going to say the you know what thing, I held it back, because they’ll say, “Horrible language. He used horrible language today.” But we’re doing fantastically. There’s never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now. Never, never. And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie, and that’s true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too. And there’s not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he’s running for the Senate. I looked at the First Lady, I said, ” Hey, he’s running for the Senate.” And today he just said Super Thursday, he’s looking forward to Super Thursday. Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military. Every day, for me and for you, it’s promises made, promises kept. One of the most important promises I made is right to this era. You know, we look at it, it’s the never ending wars in the Middle East. We’re taking our soldiers, we’re bringing them back home. We’re not law enforcement. We’re bringing them back home. American troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don’t want it. The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country. Two days ago, the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens. And all of the things that we’ve done, we’ve wiped out the terrorists, we’ve done so much, and you know what? We’re 8,000 miles away. You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan, you’ve got Afghanistan itself. The progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. You know that. We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice. As we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place. They’re not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them. We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. By the way, I have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas, any one of them, Sleepy Joe, he doesn’t have that, so he doesn’t have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd. They never say that. Hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. Right now. Spin them around. They don’t turn, they don’t turn. You notice, they don’t turn. But if there were some kind of trouble in a little corner, anything to make us look bad, that camera would turn like a pretzel. I used to think, you know, modern equipment it can’t turn, but when we would have a protestor, and I must say, I’ll say it out loud, we don’t have too many protesters anymore, do we? [inaudible 00:10:48]. No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally, but do we have a great time at a Trump rally? My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus. You know about this whole thing? Horrible. Including, sweeping travel restrictions. Today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and they’re really working hard, and they’re working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. They’re going to have vaccines I think relatively soon. And they’re going to have something that makes you better, and that’s going to actually take place we think even sooner. So a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. We went out, we’re doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. We’re working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world? I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. And we’re working with other countries. In all fairness, look, it’s a problem, we’re working with other countries. Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right? From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. Think of it, 27,000. You lose 27,000 people to the common flu. It can be much more. One year was much higher than the 70,000 number. Those people died. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn’t know that. Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, “What do we lose with the regular flu?” They said, “About 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people.” I said, “Nobody told me that. Nobody knows that.” So I actually told the pharmaceutical companies, “You have to do a little bit better job on that vaccine. Really, have to do a better job on that vaccine.” [inaudible 00:13:28]. Last year was approximately 36,000 people died. So we’re working hard on it, and we’re going to come up with some really great solutions. In the meantime, we’re stopping … Only in North Carolina. Only in North Carolina. It can only be. How many people here are from South Carolina, by the way? All right, we love both places. But that was from North Carolina. But just to finish up, so we’ve made a lot of progress, we’ve really done a great job with it. We’re keeping our borders strong. My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that’s what I’ll do. Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. But honestly, not so much anymore. Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. We’re actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. So we have our professionals in constant touch, I’m in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop. We’ve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. We’re going to safeguard our people, the United States. The United States is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness. Earlier today, when I met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly. The media didn’t know. Nobody knew. They’ve never heard this before. And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. Who knows what happened, but we’re going to reduce and the severity of what’s happening, the duration of the virus. We discussed all of these things. We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible. And I have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth. We have the greatest health system on earth. The renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion. No country is better equipped than America to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than Americans. And together, we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That’s what it is. Last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in January alone. That makes seven million jobs since the election. We have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He is dead. And we took out the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, Soleimani. While the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up American citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday. No, he said, “Super Thursday.” You can’t do these things. Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday? It would be over, right? I would be over. No matter how good you are at certain things, you can’t, as an example, a name like Sleepy Joe, he’s constantly naming the wrong state. “It’s great to be in the state of Ohio.” No, no, no, I’m sorry, you’re in North Carolina. No, no. Joe! Do you ever see them run up with a sign, “No, no, North Carolina, Joe!” Once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because it’s a disaster no matter how good you’re doing. We’re in North Carolina! It’s great to be in Idaho! No, you’re in Iowa. Nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, they’re a little scary. Did you see [inaudible 00:18:54]? We’re going to protect your second amendment, you understand that. But did you see, Sleepy Joe, did you see Sleepy Joe, where he said, “Last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country.” 150 million! That means 50% of our country. That’s a big story. 150. Can you imagine Trump saying that? These people would never let me live it down. We can’t make even a little mistake. We can’t make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake. If we make a tiny mistake, it’s headlining. They say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say Super Thursday, they say Georgia, he’s looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow. Georgia’s not in Super Tuesday! So many mistakes! You can’t do that when you’re negotiating with China. Can’t do that when you’re negotiating with these countries, can you? Those mistakes would be very tremendous. Then you have Mini Mike. You see this guy? Can you believe it? Mini Mike. He’s being interviewed tonight on Fox. Can you believe it? Fox. They want to be politically correct. They want to interview, they end up interviewing more Democrats than Republic … I don’t know what’s going on with Fox. But they’re interviewing this guy the night before … Mini Mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is. The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history. The worst in history. Nah, I got to have more. I’d get down real low, but I don’t want to copy him. Everybody saw it. Everyone said, “Oh,” they all say, “Oh! Do that again where you get down low.” But if I do that again, it’s a copy. It’s a copy! No, no. No. You never like to copy, even though you’re copying yourself. You don’t like to copy. You do it once. It was a big hit. But you do it once, and you sort of say, “That was nice, don’t do it again,” because if it doesn’t work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right? Right? We all know. But no, he’s a disaster waiting to happen. He’s a mess. No matter which Democrat candidate you’re talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates … And you see what’s happening, right? It’s being rigged against … It’s sad. It’s being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy. Crazy. I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they’re doing. I called it a long time ago. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Buttigieg, May Pete, he quit. Out last night. Then I hear a Senator from a state we’re going to win, we’re going to win that state, but she dropped out. Sounds like they made a deal. They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo, that’s why. Don’t care. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo, they made a deal. Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo. But they’ve embraced an extreme left wing agenda. Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty. You know that. The Democrat Party has gone crazy. Whether it’s Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Pocahontas’s plan … By the way, she’s history. She’s history. I came up with that name far too early, I should’ve just waited. But it didn’t matter. I thought she was making a come back. I said, “Wow, I just did it to her.” But you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago? They never caught on. In fact, she’ll probably lose the State of Massachusetts to Bernie. So she doesn’t know what to do because you’re not supposed to lose the State of Massachusetts if you get in there. She’s the Senator. She’s the Senator for Massachusetts, I think she’s going to lose it to Bernie. And Miss Michigan, you see what’s going on over there? Michigan, we’re leading. We’re leading in Wisconsin. We’re leading in Florida. We’re leading- … Wisconsin, we’re leading in Florida, we’re leading in South Carolina, we’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading in New Hampshire. We’re leading in the great state of Florida that was one of the first ones [inaudible 00:24:19] in the last election. Hey, how great was the 2016 election? One of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television. And remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one. This is going to be… oh, that wasn’t so easy for them. I love the scene. The scene of that convention center where Hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost. But Elizabeth Warren’s here to plan to eliminate our borders, or Mini Mike’s plan to eliminate your second amendment. Mike Bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment. Don’t worry about it, it’s not going to happen. Not going to happen for him. For sleepy Joe, he doesn’t even know where he is, what he’s doing, or what office he’s running for. Actually, I honestly don’t think he knows what office he’s running for. And it doesn’t matter. Maybe he gets in, because he’s a little more moderate. So maybe he gets in. But he’s not going to be running it. Other people are going to. They’re going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. But they’re going to be super left radical crazies. They’re going to be super left radical crazies, Joe’s going to be in a home. He’ll be watching television. Everything will be just fine. The insanity of Washington Democrats is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican party. Turn those [inaudible 00:26:25]. We have the enthusiasm in our party. No, I really mean it. I constantly hear about the enthusiasm. They’re fighting each other, they hate each other, they don’t know what’s going on. We have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what we’re doing. We know what we’re doing. So we’re thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors. Even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, he’s become a great friend of mine. What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that? One of the greatest statements ever made in the United State’s Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham. Come on up, Lindsey. Lindsey Graham, come on up, Lindsey. Come here, Lindsey. I got to have him say something, come here, Lindsey. [inaudible 00:28:49] great guy. Great guy, great gentleman. Now some warriors that really defended us with the impeachment hoax, one of great hoaxes in the history of country, Representative Virginia Foxx, Patrick McHenry, Richard Hudson, Mark Meadows, David Rouzer, Ted Budd. They’re warriors, these guys are unbelievable the way they fight. The last straw, I’ll tell you, I came here and then it probably weren’t scheduled to win, and fake news, CNN and [inaudible 00:30:01] they were all set. They [inaudible 00:30:03]. They handle pressure so well. They came and we gave a rally that was like this and Dan Bishop and Gregg Murphy won by so much, it wasn’t even close. They’re great people, and they’ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. They handle pressure. They were under a lot of pressure, they handled it well. It’s nice to know people can handle pressure, there aren’t too many of them. North Carolina Republican party chairman Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. I have a few great friends of mine and they love North Carolina. Louis DeJoy, who you know, Louis DeJoy. Two great people, diamond and silk. Right? Diamond and silk. We love them. You know the first lady, a long time ago now, right? How long is that? Probably almost almost five years ago, she said, “There are these two women on the internet, they’re unbelievable. They’re unbelievable.” I said, “Oh, I know, I hear that all the time. I hear it all the time.” She said, the next day she came again. She said, “I saw them again, they’re unbelievable.” I said, “Let me see.” I saw them, I fell in love with it, and everybody fell in love with Diamond and Silk. So thank you. Some people that have really been helpful to me, Corey Lewandowski, David Bussey, and Pam Bondi, right here. Thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 Republican National Convention right here in Charlotte an outstanding success, RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co chairman Tommy Hicks, and Convention president Marcia Lee Kelly, thank you all. You’re doing a great job, I’ll tell you they’re looking, they’re going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job. Should we doing a great job, but just an okay job? It doesn’t matter as long as you win. You know what I gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom. I said, “What the heck, if I win, nobody cares, if I don’t.” Look if you win, nobody cares what room you’re in. If you lose, nobody cares what room you’re in. So we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, that’s it, no big deal. I think it this way, if we win, nobody cares. And if we lose, I’m out of there, I save a hell of a lot of money. But I never thought we were going to lose. That’s on of the things they like to spread, “Trump felt that he wasn’t going to win.” Oh yeah, I’m running because I [inaudible 00:10:30], that’s not the deal. I mean it’s always possible that you don’t win, but boy I thought we were going to win and we were getting crowds like this actually, to be honest, I think our crowds now are bigger, stronger, and even more enthusiastic. I really think they’re more enthusiastic than ever before. And then there’s two set we’re eight months away, that’s a long, it’s not even our, in case you haven’t heard, we’ve got it made in the primers. For us, we’re not even really political season and we’re getting crowds like this, we were all over the last couple of weeks. We like to troll. We like to go the night before one of their primers. We do a little trolling, it’s called we do a little trolling. Bernie Sanders was very upset, “Why would he be there?” Why? Because I want to win, I want to keep everybody happy. That’s such a good reason. Honestly, when you’re two months or three months out, we’re getting numbers that are unbelievable. Colorado went, we went to Iowa, every place we’ve gone, New Hampshire. Every place we’ve gone, just came out of South Carolina, you saw that. That was an incredible [inaudible 00:35:57]. Every place that we’ve gone, it’s been amazing. I’d also like to recognize, so important, a woman who’s really helped us win North Carolina in 2016, I have a feeling this year, she’ll even do better, because she happened to grow up here, Lara Trump and my son Eric Trump. Two great people. I mean I have to say that about my son, but I know a lot of people don’t like their sons that much, but Lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job. She knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here. How are we doing, Lara? How are we doing? How are we doing in the state, are we doing good? And we’re doing well in Pennsylvania I hear, and South Carolina, I know we’re doing great there. Also with us tonight, is a man who’s really become a good friend of mine. We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didn’t get along, I would not be here. I wouldn’t do this. I think he’s been tremendous. He’s been a tremendous supporter and things that we’ve wanted to do, and fights that we’ve had which were so important, he’s been right up, and Lizzie will tell you that he’s been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term. Probably a lot longer than that, but he’s going to come up and I’m going to ask Senator Thom Tillis, come on up. Thom has really been incredible, he’s been working everyday. And he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration. Thom is the champion for the people of North Carolina. This November, we need everybody to go and vote for Thom, he’s doing great. He’s doing great. I hear he’s way up in the polls, he’s way up in the polls. Thom, say a few words. Wow. Hey that’s pretty good, that’s pretty good, Thom. Lot of times we get people up and they just can’t do it. They start breathing bad, they can’t breathe, “Oh help me,” like Bloomberg. Did you see the debate? Huh? She came after him. She’s mean, she’s very mean. She came after him and he started chocking [inaudible 00:41:10] “Get me off this stage. Get me off. You guys didn’t tell me this was going to happen.” No, that was great Thom. We’re also honored to be joined tonight by a true American hero, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old. His name is George Washington Perry, legit. George, thank you very much for being here. Thank you, George. 100 years. He’s 100 and he looks good. Thank you, George. With the help of everyone here tonight, America has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth. Since my election over 219,000 new jobs have been created right here in North Carolina. We have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps. Median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history, that’s happening, that’s happening. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history. Very important to me, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. For decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed African Americans. My administration is delivering for African Americans like never before. No president has done more for our black community, no president has done more for our black community, and it’s an honor to do it. Last month here in Charlotte, we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all Americans. It’s called Opportunity Now, you know about it. We’re also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave, reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40,000,000 american families an average of $2,200 thanks to the Republican child tax credit. The Republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did, but the Democrats are saying, “How did they do that one?” We’re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies and decimated manufacturing in North Carolina, you know all about. It’s probably the number one reason running, and the deals we’re making, the trade deals, are unbelievable. Your state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed, think of that. Weeks ago, we finally ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new US [inaudible 00:20:57]. The USMCA is a giant for North Carolina’s incredible farmers and factory workers. And by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax. You know about the death tax, right? It’s called the inheritance tax. You have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax. So if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, there’s no tax to be paid by your children. So they don’t have to go back to the evil banker, borrow money from the banker, lose the farm, lose the business, it won’t happen. And I always say, I know a lot of parents that don’t love the children very much. Is there anybody in this room that does not love your children? Please raise your hand. Please raise your hand. Nobody. Nobody, that’s because we’re North Carolina, you love your children. But if you don’t, then it doesn’t matter because if you don’t love your children, don’t leave them a damn thing, but you don’t have the inheritance tax anymore, which is great. A lot of people don’t even know that, but that’s a big deal or no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betraying the American people than on the issue of immigration. Every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens, on your tax. Not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it is threatens innocent lives as just one heartbreaking example, two illegal aliens in Maryland who had been previously charged with attempted murder were released, unaccountably released, and they went on to further a teenage girl beating her with a baseball bat and slashing her with a machete. The entire democratic field supports [inaudible 00:47:15] sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities. Right here in North Carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it. Killing her and dumping her body into the woods. Last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina, how did that happen to North Carolina? Deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of, and these are really dangerous criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of burglary, gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even mur- Gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even murder. Got to change it. Your Democrat Governor, Roy Cooper, vetoed a bill that would save North Carolina lives and ban sanctuary cities [inaudible 00:48:18]. What is he thinking? But while your super Liberal Governor is putting your families at risk, your Republican Senator Thom Tillis has introduced a bill allowing American victims to sue sanctuary cities for the horrible pain and [inaudible 00:49:06] suffering they inflict on our people. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. Mexico’s paying for the wall, by the way. We built 127 miles as of today, 127. Mexico is paying for the wall. The media is going to be thrilled when I explain that Mexico is paying for the wall because you know, now finally they said I’ve had obstruction like you wouldn’t believe. The entire democratic party. I could get anything. I created Space Force. I could do anything. I could get. Lindsey and Thom Tillis knows. Mark knows this. All of them knows this. If I wanted 25 cents for the wall, they didn’t want to get it. They didn’t want to do it, but now we got it, and you think that’s easy? Nobody else could have done this. We’re building it. We’re building our hearts away. We’ll soon be building many, many miles a week, but we’re up to over 125, I guess 127, 28 by now, of the super duper wall, super duper. I went to Border Patrol, I said, ” What is your wish?” “Well, sir, we’d like it to be steel and concrete.” They want it exactly what they have it, and the barriers up top, they want everything. It’s called a no climb provisor, no climb provisor. I said, “What does the word provisor mean?” They didn’t know. All it means is you’re not able to climb over it. It is very tough. I don’t know if you saw. In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down. That’s what the no climb is. That’s what the no climb is. It’s a no climb. It’s more money. It’s a little more expensive. Thank you. Who is that? What a voice. Pavarotti. So, we’re building the wall. It’s going great. So, they said, “All right. He’s building the wall, but Mexico’s not paying for it.” Yes, they are. You’ll see. You’ll see. You understand. Some of you understand because I told a few people last week, it got linked to the fake news media. If you want to end sanctuary cities in North Carolina and across America, then you have only one choice. You must vote Republican. You have to. You have to. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last [inaudible 00:03:29]. We’ve added catch and release, one of the worst loopholes you’ve ever seen, catch and release. You catch them. You then say, “Where do you live?” They don’t know because look, let’s face it, they don’t know. I understand that. It’s not even to be laughed at. They don’t know. “Where do you live?” I don’t know. Mexico, maybe, Honduras, Guatemala, who knows? El Salvador. “Where do you live?” Like this guy, he’s a Mexican. You’re about as Mexican as I am. Look at this guy. He’s as Mexican as I am. Look at that hat. Are you Mexican? Are you Mexican? No, you’re not. Are you? He is. It’s like Elizabeth Warren. She said she was an Indian. I said, “I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none. She said, “Oh, this is terrible.” So she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her. Right? 1024th, right? One thousandths, so I was right. I probably have more in me. What a phony she is. What a phony. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 Congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders’ healthcare takeover. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security, and they are going to destroy your social security. Remember they used to say with me, “I’m going to end it the first day.” Well, you know what, we’re going to soon be four years and all I’ve done is make it stronger. You know that. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. You’re going to have great health. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember President Obama? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. 28 times. They said, “Impeach him. You should impeach him.” 28 times he lied. 28 times on record, “You can keep your doc"
Donald Trump ,2016,Introducing Governor Mike Pence as the 2016 Republican Vice Presidential Nominee in New York City,"Thank you, everybody. Great honor. Great honor, thank you. This is a wonderful day. Aww. [Chants of Trump, Trump, Trump] Wow.  On a Saturday morning yet. Isn't that nice? Thank you, all. And we're going to have an incredible convention. It's really going well. We're going to have an incredible convention. And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly. So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system -- we are in a rigged, rigged system -- and to make America safe again and to make America great again. I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France. We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look. And now it's happening more and more. And it's never going to stop. We need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need in our country law and order. And if I'm elected president, that will happen. [applause] I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation. And as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people. We wish them well. It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well. A lot of -- a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out. Now, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years. The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control. After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path. He didn't know what he was doing. Iraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end. Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems. We also need to bring back in this country -- because we see what happened -- our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs. They've been taken away, like we're babies. Taken away. And we're going to bring them back. I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous -- really prosperous society for all Americans. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana. And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute. But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person. [applause] Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration. It's horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it's out of control. Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She's a corrupt person. What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She's crooked Hillary. [applause] And I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails -- but it wasn't a loss, she discarded -- that in itself is a major crime. Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton. Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK? Didn't give them to the FBI? Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK? Wipes her server clean, that's OK? These are crimes. These are crimes. And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't. But I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around. She's going to pay it at the polls. I believe that. [applause] On top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time. She's totally owned by Wall Street. We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism. And it's not that she believes in it. The people that give her all of this money believe in it. And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe. Believe me. That's it. [applause] What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence. [applause] Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam. Radical Islamic terrorism. You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window. You heard what he was screaming out the window. You saw it in San Bernardino. You saw it at the World Trade Center. You saw it in Orlando. How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris. You see it all over. And Hillary is a weak person. We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party. We're going to change things around. There's going to be respect again for law and order. [applause] Hillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS. You know, she's talking -- I see the ads she puts on. If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests. Got a lot of money. But I see the ads on foreign policy. She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience. Of course not. I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson. I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq. Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson. I was a civilian. Take the oil. Many, many calls I've made. You take a look. I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen. I was the one that predicted it. And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong. President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win. I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do. And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from. And I said that Brexit's going to happen. I said that they are going to break away. And everybody laughed at me. And the odds were 20 percent. And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen. And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right. I appreciate that. Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK. So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy. So important. Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. Because I'm an outsider. I want to be an outsider. I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides. I won in landslides. This wasn't close. This wasn't close. [applause] No, this wasn't close. This was -- in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three. There were 17. We got -- I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger -- I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes. That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president. Think of it. That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love. That's more than Richard Nixon. It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness. Pretty good. It's more than the Bushes. But I mean by a lot. I don't mean by a little. But that's with 17 people. People don't over-say that. That means our message is unbelievable. And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing. But they displayed it. It was on display, where we had this group of people, who -- many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK? Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump. Oh, we're going to win. They got crushed. And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen. They're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers. We're going to put 'em back to work. [applause] So they're very tired of it. But I want to thank all of those people that – delegates-- that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something. Did we show them something. And unfortunately, the vote was very late. But essentially, we had 112-12. This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight. We're not going to have a fight. People agree with what we've -- they want the wall. They want the borders. They want these things to happen. And what we're doing... [applause] And what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it. We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination. The evangelicals have been unbelievable. I dominated with the evangelicals. A lot of people were surprised. They say he's not perfect. But you know what? They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart. [applause] And I said -- and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do. You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group. And he was a powerful president. He knew how to get things done. He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him. But he was a powerful president. And we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status. We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment. And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk. I saw this. I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid? And they didn't know how to answer the question. And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out. One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues. We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political. And I looked out the window. I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street. I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't. That means they're more powerful than you are. We have to do something about it. How did it start? How did it start? [applause] And they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson. And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader. And he did this, and he got it done. And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away. And we're going to change that. OK? All right. [applause] Back to Mike Pence. So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big. Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall. That's where Trump was going down -- they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places. But Indiana was going to be the firewall. So I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before. NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country. Manufacturing down in some states 55, 60 percent. It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places. I have a friend who's a great builder. What he builds is plants. That's all he does, is build plants. He doesn't build buildings. He doesn't -- he builds plants. It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear. I said, how's business? I was with him the other day. How's business? He goes unbelievable. I said, really, wow, I'm surprised. Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country. He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe. I said, what do you mean? He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen. I said, what about this country? Not much. Not much. That's the expression. He said exactly that. Not much. I said, but Mexico? He said, you've never seen anything like it. It's incredible. Folks, that's going to stop. We're going to go reverse it. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country. We can't be the stupid people anymore. OK? [applause] And he was better than a pollster. He's better than a consultant. I would say, how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars. Doesn't cost me millions. Me, I give them $10,000, OK? [laughter] It costs other people millions. It costs other campaigns millions to get a report. Every time they get a report, it's millions. But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report. And he said it. He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it. Just fact. How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico. In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it. And if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan. We want them to build them in Michigan. They're going to build them in Michigan. And you know that I know how to do that. So easy. So easy. But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution. There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here. There are consequences. And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country. It's very simple. And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike. [laughter] Indiana's unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing. [applause] Incredible family. Highly respected. Expected to go for another four years. He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana. Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen. When he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states. I've gone to all of them. And every time, I have statisticians. I say give me the stats on a state. And it's always bad, down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here's somebody where it's gone up. Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013. That's like very unusual. Governor Pence balanced the budget. Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing. We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion. He balanced the budget. They don't know what that means. Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana. It's also rated triple-A, their bonds are rated triple-A. Very few states have that. Triple-A. The best. That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, triple-A. Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it's not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana. And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor. Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind. [applause] If you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said the, really -- they're doing much better, the V.A. is much better. They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for. People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on -- they can't even see a doctor. It's a scandal. Take a look at what's happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what's happening with -- you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It's a scandal. It's corrupt. It's incompetent. It's a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact. [applause] So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best. Got 'em jobs. Got 'em jobs. Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That's a great thing. They're going to stay there. That's a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy. Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the state's history. So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education. Isn't that a great thing? [applause] Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America. School choice is where it's at, folks. You want to get your schools better, you gotta get rid of Common Core fast. Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history. Think of that. We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets. And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country. CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure. So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up. That had so much -- look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump. I build infrastructure. Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure? You know, it's very interesting. We're building -- we're building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing -- probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services. And I really like what's happened. We're going to have an opening very soon. Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it. But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year – but we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially. And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do. [applause] And when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before. They've never heard them. So when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work -- also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke -- who's now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country. The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there. And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide. And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember. He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted -- who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy -- but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump. I said, who did he endorse? So even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non-endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK? I will tell you. [applause] So with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]"
Donald Trump,2016,"Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio","Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon – and I mean very soon – come to an end.Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.These are the facts:Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone. We're going to fix that.The budget is no better.President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.Let's defeat her in November, OK.I am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control.After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect, the respect we deserve. The American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it's for their benefit.Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change...never ever. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.I am your voice!I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.[disruption in the audience] How great are our police? And how great is Cleveland?I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way.And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent,"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes.In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs, and strip us of our wealth as a country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me, believe me. I will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.This Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember: it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them at every level.When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child.To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we are going to defeat them fast.Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations.Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community – no good and we're going to stop it.As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology – beleive me.And as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel. Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this. Think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve. We have to solve it.These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain, believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine, and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh, it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so so horribly?These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say.On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class.I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many. It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the richest people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or, frankly, any other country.Never, ever again.I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. I will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America fist, again! America first! Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want. We are going to start building and making things again.Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone.America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it will happen, and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald Trump as President. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing, and that's what she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster! Thank you. Thank you.We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying.My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.The replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what, the support they have given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. So true. They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job? My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.Remember: All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people that wouldn't stand -- I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Love it, love it, love it. No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now.It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: ""I'm With Her"". I choose to recite a different pledge.My pledge reads: ""I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.""I am your voice.So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.God bless you, and good night! I love you!"
Donald Trump,2016,"News Conference in Doral, Florida","Donald Trump. So, it's been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference. And you, as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports, should ask yourselves why. And I'll tell you why. Because despite the nice platitudes, she's been a mess.You look at what's happened with ISIS, which isn't even mentioned. You look at what's happening with law and order, they don't even mention our police. They mention everybody but our police. They don't have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags, one that we saw.So you know, I put myself through your news conferences often, not that its fun. 235 days, no news conference for Hillary Clinton. You oughta check it out because there's a lot going on.Her great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she totally rigged it. Bernie Sanders never had a chance.And total disloyalty, it's like you're fired, get out, fast. The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation, both very serious. What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible, absolutely horrible.If I would've used language like they used about religion, about race, about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I would've had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race.With her, everything's just fine. So just ask yourself why she doesn't have news conferences. And honestly, the reason is because there's no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad.When they talk about change, I noticed they have change. She's been there for 30 years. Thirty years. There's no change. It's going to be the same, it's going to be an extension of Obama. In my opinion, worse.She lied about TPP. She was for TPP, she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because it's a horror show, it's going to kill all our jobs, it's going to be almost as bad as NAFTA, maybe worse which her husband signed, by the way, which destroyed this country, destroyed manufacturing in the United States.And I'll do something about it, that'll be so renegotiated. And by the way, yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements. First time, yesterday. Well, because of me.She also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation. And she heard it and she said wow, she can't win that subject in a debate.So all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP, her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now he's going against it. And Bernie Sanders was right, he was against it.They will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins, which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesn't. They will vote it in—just mark my words, hopefully we don't have to worry about it—but she will vote.She'll change a comma, she'll change a paragraph of the 6,000 page document that nobody's even read on our side. Just so you understand, the other countries know every word, every paragraph, every sentence, every single comma and period.We don't even read it, our country. Because we're led by stupid people. so she saw me talking about TPP, she realized that she couldn't defend it, her special interests are pushing her hard because she's bought and sold by the special interests.They're pushing her very hard and so she said she's against it. The day she gets in—which hopefully will never happen—she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP. And that will be another disaster for job in our country, OK?So why don't we start off any questions? Yes, sir?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia. In fact, I saw her campaign manager I don't know his title, Mook. I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hacking.By the way, they hacked—they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.But I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked. Now, first of all was what was said on those that's so bad but he said I watched it. I think he was live. But he said we think it was Russia that hacked.And then he said—and this is in person sitting and watching television as I've been doing—and then he said could be Trump, yeah, yeah. Trump, Trump, oh yeah, Trump. He reminded me of John Lovitz for ""Saturday Night Live"" in the liar where he'd go yes, yes, I went to Harvard, Harvard, yes, yes. This is the guy, you have to see it. Yes, it could be Trump, yes, yes. So it is so farfetched. It's so ridiculous. Honestly I wish I had that power. I'd love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our country.And that's why—if it is Russia, nobody even knows this, it's probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed. But it shows how weak we are, it shows how disrespected we are. Total—assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country. Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader. So I know nothing about it. It's one of the most farfetched I've ever heard. Yes, Jon?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but there's nothing that I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I'm all for it and let's go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast.You saw what happened with the priest, it's only going to get worse. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are, where they come from, where their documentation is, it's only going to get worse and it's going to start getting bad in our country. We're letting people come in by the tens of thousands. You see what happened to the French priest. A friend of mine, he said he was going to France, like three, four months ago. I saw him yesterday. I said how'd you like France. He said I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to France. Because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. They won't like me for saying that but you see what happened in Nice, you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man. France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and they'll never do it with Hillary Clinton.And by the way, in terms of change, she's been there for 30 years. She's been doing this for 30 years. What she's going to go all of sudden things are going to change? She's bought and sold 100 percent by special interests and lobbyists. Yes, Tom?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. None, none.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Because it's under order. And I'll release them when the audits completed. Nobody would release when it's under—I've had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. I'm under audit, when the audits complete I'll release them. But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I don't know, I don't know. It depends on the audit. It depends on the audit, not a big deal. By the way, just so you understand, I've released my papers, 104 pages of documents. I built an unbelievable company, tremendous cash, tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world. You've seen it. You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but that's OK. Far, far great than anybody ever thought. I have a great company. I built an unbelievable company but if you look there you'll see there's nothing in Russia.And as far as the tax returns, as soon as the audits complete, like any lawyer would tell you, Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago, she's a lawyer. She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when they're under audit. It's a routine audit. I've gone through audits, which I think is very unfair, for 15 years. I have friends that are very rich and never get audited. I'm audited every year. Maybe that's because of politics, who knows.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I'm not going to tell Putin what to do. Why should I tell Putin what to do? He already did something today where he said don't blame them, essentially, for your incompetence. Let me tell you, it's not even about Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking. It was about the things that were said in those e-mails. They were terrible things, talking about Jewish, talking about race, talking about atheist, trying to pin labels on people—what was said was a disgrace, and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and believe me, as sure as you're sitting there, Hillary Clinton knew about it. She knew everything.Debbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary Clinton. Couldn't breathe. And you saw that. It also showed that it was a fixed race, but I've been saying that long before I saw the e-mails. It was a rigged race. It was totally rigged. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary Clinton, and the sad part is, Bernie Sanders has, to use an old word that I use on occasion, he's lost his energy. He wants to go home and go to sleep. But he's got a lot of people that walked out last night. Now, hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night. I didn't even hear about it. Nobody showed it. I didn't see it on television. You people don't talk about it.The Republican Convention was incredible. I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades. Like, some people are saying nine points. In fact, a poll just came out ten minutes ago, ""Los Angeles Times"", Trump 47, Clinton 40. And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary Clinton.Question. [inaudible] Putin say stay out? Why not say that?Donald Trump. Why do I have to get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia—which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is—but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see—I will tell you this—Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir...Question. [inaudible] this audience and make our campaign—what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum wage in this country [inaudible]?OK. Sure. Two big questions. The minimum wage has to go up. People are—at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states—federal—I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage—but it has to go up.Now, Bernie Sanders lied. Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7. I said, where did he come up with that one? That one is just like Joe Biden lied today. He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—he was on television—he said, Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the Middle East. Now, that was Ted Cruz that said that. That was not Donald Trump. I mean, he's not a very bright guy, but that was Ted Cruz that said it. And he said it with such surety—Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—I never said I wanted to carpet bomb. That was Ted Cruz. You remember Ted Cruz said it? You will confirm that, I think. Go ahead.So I would like to raise it to at least $10, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to—literally, they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country, because I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico, which is booming, booming. I have a friend who builds plants and he's a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day—great guy. He builds massive plants, for automobiles, for computers, for anything. That's what he does. I think he's the biggest, but certainly one of the biggest.And I said, how's it going? He said, unbelievable. Oh good, that's good news. The country's doing well. No, the country's not doing well, but Mexico is unbelievable. The plants I'm building in Mexico, I've never seen anything—it's the eighth wonder of the world. And he's not happy. He's an American guy. He'd rather build them here. But he said it's unbelievable. That's what's happened to our country. Because we have leadership that doesn't know what they're doing.Question. [inaudible] special extreme vetting?Donald Trump. Yes we're going to be listing; yeah we're going to be giving a list of those territories. And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting. And we're going to have extreme vetting anyway. Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions. And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether it's the World Trade Center or whether it's a lot of other things, and you look all over the world and you see what's happening.You look at Orlando, how bad was that? And that was horrible. That was going after the gay community it looks like. We can't let this happen. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let people come in.Now Hillary Clinton likes to up it. Her running mate Tim Kaine, who by the way did a terrible job in New Jersey. First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and he's not very popular in New Jersey. And he still isn't. What?I mean Virginia. The first thing he did, the first thing that Tim Kaine did, he asked for a $4 billion tax increase. And he's not very popular. So let me just tell you, and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day. And I thought he'd be popular. He's not popular because he asked for tax increases. Big tax increases in Virginia. Big. And also the unemployment went up, I think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenure.But what he wanted to do is very strongly and he's on record, he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary Clinton wants. And it's unacceptable. OK. Yes? [inaudible]Question. Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the charges...Donald Trump. I saw that.Question. Against police involved in the Freddie Gray case.Donald Trump. Right.Question. Your reaction [inaudible]?Donald Trump. I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers, I do. I think she ought to prosecute herself OK? That's my reaction. I think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it. And the news conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the facts.And I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal. I give a lot of respect, a lot of credit that they stuck it out. And you had victory after victory after victory. And she had no chance, don't forget she prosecuted the best case, what she thought was her best cases first. She should prosecute herself. She should be held accountable.Question. [inaudible] to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case. Freddie Gray is now a cause celebre.Donald Trump. Well, that was a bad case to prove it. That was a bad case. I mean if you're going to do that, it's OK because you have to, you know, there are times when police officers behave very badly. But you have to get the right time. This was not one of those times. And I think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did. Yes ma'am?Question. So as you've gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about him...Donald Trump. Yeah.Question. And [inaudible]...Donald Trump. I have a great relationship with Governor Pence. We spent the last three days together. He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press. The press was saying, and it was interesting, I spoke to him at 11:05, him and his wife, and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if I'd be lucky enough for him to accept. And he accepted. And that was it. For me that was it.But right around that time you had the attack in Nice. And I was going to have a news conference either the following morning or the next day. And of course I had to delay the news conference because there was attack, a horrible attack, horrible. In France. And I delayed the news conference and everyone said, oh he's having second thoughts. I never had a second thought in my life. It was such a lie. I mean so many lies in the press. But it was such a lie. And he has been so great. Honestly he's been even better than I thought OK? Better.Question. Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of date?Donald Trump. I think everything's is out of date. We have a whole new world. When I said that NATO, to Wolf Blitzer, is obsolete, I got attacked. Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right. You know what? We have a lot of things that are out date because they're 20 and 30 and 40 years old.NATO, you know this isn't a country from 40 years ago. Today we have a different threat. We have a terror threat. And we have an ISIS threat. And by the way, ISIS isn't even mentioned. It's not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention. And everyone's talking about it. The reason they can't mention it is because they grew it.Go ahead.Question. What would you renegotiate: the enhanced interrogation aspect of it? The...Donald Trump. I would—Katy, I would renegotiate so much of everything. I'm going to renegotiate our trade deals where we're losing with everybody, Katy. I'm going to renegotiate our military deals where we're protecting countries and they're not living up to the bargain. They're not living up to the bargain. And everyone agrees with me, except for the media.And the media never says that. I like NATO, just so you understand. I like NATO. I like the concept of NATO. It is somewhat outdated because it doesn't cover terror the way it should. I've been saying this for six months now. A couple of months ago, front page, Wall Street Journal, ""We are going to cover terror,"" they announced somebody.I think NATO's great. But it's got to be modernized. And—and countries that we're protecting have to pay what they're supposed to be paying.Question. On the Geneva Convention [inaudible].Donald Trump. Yes?Question. Do you think that they should allow for that, given the [inaudible]?Donald Trump. I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation, yes.And by the way, it works.Question. [inaudible] will you defend the Baltic states if they're invaded by Russia? According to...Donald Trump. I'll tell you what. Let me say it once again. Let me say it once again. OK? Many countries, including the NATO countries, some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe. And they can afford to pay this. It's not like they can't afford it.They just see us as a soft touch. You know, in business we say somebody's a soft touch. I don't know if I've been called a soft touch, but maybe I have sometimes. But in business, they call them a soft touch. They haven't paid us. OK? I want them to pay.Excuse me. I'm not saying anything. I don't talk. I'm not like Obama where he tells you everything he's going to do—we're going to go and do this; we're going to go and do that. I don't talk. But they're going to pay.No, no—yeah, it sends a signal. You know what signal it says? It says we're going to pay.You know, somebody said, ""but we have treaties."" I said that's right. And in the treaties, they're supposed to pay. They're going to pay. And they will pay. They will pay.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Yes?Question. [inaudible] how are you planning to [inaudible]?Donald Trump. We're going to have a whole policy on that over the next three weeks. I'm going to be doing a big thing on that.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Well, I've been doing very well with the Hispanic community. I mean, really well. I mean, the—the poll numbers are going up very high. I think we had one recently 35 or 36. But I'm going to have a whole—we're going to have a news conference on that over the next three weeks.So, and I want to just tell you because these polls cover it, so L.A. Times, 47-40; CNN, way up. They're all way up. Biggest—they say the biggest bounce in memory. Because today I heard a dishonest guy on television say, ""Well, Trump didn't get much of a bounce."" So, you know, I have to at least say.Jeremy, go ahead.Question. [inaudible] do you believe that Vladimir Putin would rather deal with President Trump or President Clinton?Donald Trump. I don't think he respects Clinton. I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton. I think he does respect me. And I hope I get along great with him. It's possible that we won't, Jeremy. I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship.Right now, we don't have a good relationship. Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things. OK? He mentioned the ""N"" word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the ""N"" word. You know what the ""N"" word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked.He has a total lack of respect for President Obama. Number one, he doesn't like him. And number two, he doesn't respect him. I think he's going to respect your president if I'm elected. And I hope he likes me.Yes? Yes, sir?Question. [inaudible] relations?Donald Trump. Yes, sir.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. But let me finish with Jeremy. Go ahead.Question. Would a President Trump be better for U.S.-Russia relations than [inaudible]?Donald Trump. President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations. You can't be worse. Hey look, when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that I've always found fascinating, one thing that I've always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China. Well, they're united now, in a true sense. They've never been closer.They're selling oil to China. We forced them into this position.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. No, wait a minute.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. No, I'm not going to be an adversary. No, not at all. I have tenants from China. I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent. I mean, I have great relationships with China. I'm not blaming China for getting away with murder. I'm blaming our leadership is incompetent. We don't know what we're doing.I don't blame—I respect China. Hey, if China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars—if they can get away with that, my hat's off to them.I have no problem with China. I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen. And I believe that Hillary Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack Obama. I think it will get worse.It's going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people, you see that. But I believe that Hillary Clinton will be worse, than Obama.Yes?Question. [off-mike] you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordable.Donald Trump. That's right.Question. Working on a plan...Donald Trump. That's right, I'm going to be doing something over the next four weeks, very much so.Question. Are you prepared to give us any sort of...Donald Trump. No, I'm prepared to say we're gonna have a great plan. One of the things I think because I've traveled all over the country and I'm going—you know where I'm going, I guess you all know, I don't have to say.But I'm going to Toledo and I'm going to different places today and I've met so many people. This is such a great country, these are such great people. one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard, that go to colleges, good colleges, they're good students, they do a great job.Number one, they get out, they have no jobs. Because our jobs are going to Mexico, they're going to China, they're going to Japan, they're going all over the place. They're not coming here. Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesn't build them here, much.And the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their—up to their neck. They can't breathe, they're scared, they're so scared they have leveraged their entire life. They have loans.And I have to tell you, the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it. Because the students get government money, passes through but the number gets higher and higher.Because college costs are out of control, because the colleges say what difference does it make? If you take a look at the salaries being paid, you take a look at what's going on with the colleges.Because all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it. So the colleges are costing so much money. We are going to help the students. Maybe that doesn't fit beautifully within the Republican framework.But I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it. We have to help our students. Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where it's making them sick.Our students are under tremendous pressure, we have to help our students. And I'm going to have a plan over the next four weeks.[crosstalk]Question. [off-mike] talking about possibly...Donald Trump. Everything's on the table, you'll see. Everything—it's a very important—it's a very important subject.Yes, ma'am?Question. Mr. Trump, [off-mike].Donald Trump. I think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border, if they don't want people pouring into our country. Likewise, they have confidence with me on ISIS, not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because I will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our people.I think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like there's nothing to it. And then they make their product, they sell it back to the United States, no tax, no nothing, we get nothing except unemployment.And I think people see that. I can tell you I mean I'm like a pollster myself when I'm in front of these massive audiences, one of the things that gets constantly—you people know because you're there—the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare.Because Obamacare is a disaster. In Texas, going through BlueCross/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase. On November 1st, you're going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare, having to do with increases. President Obama is trying to get it moved to December. Because it is election-defying. It is going to be a massive number, the biggest number ever in our country's history for health care. It's going to be announced on November 1st.I just asked the press, don't let him do that. Obamacare is a disaster, people are dying with it. It's a disaster and everybody knows and it's going to fold, anyway.In '17 unfortunately—if I'm president—I mean I've got to take over this mess. It's going to fold, anyway. But repeal and replace Obamacare, people like it.They like the fact that I'm going to protect the Second Amendment, they like the fact that I'm going to rebuild our military which is very depleted. Those are the things that are resonating.And they don't feel Hillary Clinton can do it.John, go ahead, John.Question. [off-mike] Russia has no business in you—that you don't have any...Donald Trump. No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John. How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia.And even—for anything. What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Florida.Palm Beach is a very expensive place. There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I told it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago. I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Of course I can. I told you, other than normal stuff—I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian. I have nothing to do with Russia. I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Of course not. I own the Trump organization. Zero, zero. Go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I am.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I did.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. I did. Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United States. But she would be so wrong. And even women say that. Women don't like her. She would be so wrong. Look, Hillary Clinton is a disaster. She's been a disaster. And even the story told by her husband last night, he left out the most interesting chapter. I won't get into that.The chapter that I really waited for, because it was pretty boring, the chapter that I waited for, I never heard. And he left it out. Look, Hillary Clinton's a disaster. I'd love to see a woman become president and it'll happen, absolutely. But I think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary Clinton. Yes ma'am?Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes, I do.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful, they have to be very, very well trained. I speak about it all the time, in fact I mentioned the most recent death, excuse me, I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota. I speak about it all the time. It's a real problem because if the police do 100,000 great jobs and they have one, either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job, you see that incident on television for weeks. It's a real problem.You don't see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100,000, out of more than that, it's on television night after night after night. The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time. Yes, ma'am, go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Oh, go ahead, go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. No, but they seem to be, if it's Russians. I have no idea. It's probably not Russia. Nobody knows if it's Russia. You know the sad thing is? That with the technology and the genius we have in this country, not in government unfortunately, but with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails. We don't even know who it is.I heard this morning, one report said they don't think it's Russia, they think it might be China. Another report said it might be just a hacker, some guy with a 200 I.Q. that can't get up in the morning, OK? Nobody knows. Honestly they have no idea if it's Russia. Might be Russia. But if it's any foreign country, it shows how little respect they have for the United States. Yes, ma'am.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Well, and the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people, they've got something bad going on up there. That's something really bad going "
Donald Trump,2016,"News Conference in Doral, Florida","on. And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism, a term that our president refuses to use, I can't he's still not using it. He's still not using it. And she doesn't want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it. She said she will use it but so far she didn't.She'll probably use it tonight. Like the American flags, as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage, it was a disgrace. You had a room with a massive stage without flags. I think this—I think that the people in the community know what's going on. Whether it's in a mosque or whether it's in the community and they have to report these people. When you look at San Bernardino, people knew—many people knew what was going on. They had bombs lying all over the floor. They had bombs on the floor. I mean, this isn't—you walk into somebody's house, there are bombs lying on the floor—I think there's a problem there. You got to report it.And by the way, David Hinckley should not have been freed, OK? David Hinckley was just released—John Hinckley—I think that John Hinckley—excuse me, John Hinckley, should not have been freed. I just heard about it.[crosstalk]Question. Do you have any pause about asking a foreign government—Russia, China, anybody—to interfere, to hack into the system of anybody's in this country...Donald Trump. That's up to the President. Let the President talk to them. Look, here's the problem. Here's the problem, Katy. Katy, here's the problem, very simple. He has no respect...Question. [inaudible] 30,000 e-mails...Donald Trump. Well, they probably have them. I'd like to have them released.Question. Does that not give you pause?Donald Trump. No, it gives me no pause. If they have them, they have them. We might as well—hey, you know what gives me more pause? That a person in our government, crooked Hillary Clinton—here's what gives me pause. Be quiet. I know you want to save her. That a person in our government, Katy, would delete or get rid of 33,000 e- mails. That gives me a big problem. After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 e-mails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.[crosstalk]Question. A question about Mike Pence, because ""The New York Times"" reported that [inaudible] conversation with John Kasich's campaign, [inaudible] says, you can be the most powerful [inaudible]...Donald Trump. That's the most ridiculous conversation. He never had the—Don Jr. told me—let me just tell you. Let me save you a lot of boredom.Question. [inaudible] Mike Pence's role as vice president if you are elected?Donald Trump. Mike Pence will play a big role, but I just want to tell you about John Kasich. I never spoke to him about being vice president. We don't have good chemistry together. I have never spoken to him about being vice president. I would never pick him to be vice president. There was never a conversation, and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little bit shaky. He never spoke—Don Jr. would never—and that was so long ago, I didn't even know I was going to get the nomination at that point. Just so you understand, I would not have picked John Kasich, wouldn't be the right guy. I mean, for that to have gotten out, that was so ridiculous. And then, I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy. So what's left for the president? I think you know me better than that. That was put out by him. He's a nice man, John Kasich, he's fine. He's fine. I would never have chosen him.Now, I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people. There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice president, but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike Pence is doing a great job.Let me just explain—I never asked John Kasich to be vice president, nor would I. And by the way, I'm leading in Ohio by three points.Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. It probably has. It probably has. Our government is so weak on this stuff. It probably has. Possible. I mean, I have a lot of checks and balance. I have a good system, I guess. I'm not an e- mail person, myself. I don't believe in it, because I think it can be hacked, for one thing. But when I send an e-mail, I mean, if I send one, I send one almost never. I'm just not a believer in e-mail. A lot of people have taught me that, including Hillary. But honestly, it could be, maybe it's hacked. Who knows?Question. [inaudible] broken the rules in traditional American politics many times. [inaudible] while the other person...Donald Trump. Yes, but my message wasn't dark. My message was optimistic, because we're going to fix the problems. Go ahead.Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. OK.Question. You've broken that tradition, you've run a very aggressive campaign this week. What was the basis for wanting to do it this way as opposed to staying quiet...Donald Trump. No basis. No basis.Look, John, I didn't have to do this. When I did this, believe me—you see this incredible resort. It's one of the great in the world. When I did this, I could be here enjoying myself. I don't have to be with you guys. I didn't need this. I have places that are the best in the world, OK. I could be doing other things. I'm doing this because we're going to make America great again. I'm doing this because when I looked at the Iran deal, which was incompetent—when I looked at what's going on with jobs being torn out of our country and going to Mexico and China, what's happening with China. And with all of this, with ISIS, with our military being so badly depleted where we have old fighter jets. We have to take parts from museums and from graveyards.When I look at all this I say I sort of have to do it. You know this country's been great to me. I'm giving back. That's all.Now as far as running a campaign, I guess it's probably not typical. But they said that against, you know when I ran there was 17 people, a total of 17. Governors, Senators, Ben Carson who's a fantastic guy, capable people. Wait a minute. Everybody said, oh he can never win because look what he's doing. He's giving a talk to 5,000 people in New Hampshire instead of going to everybody's house and having dinner.And then I won New Hampshire. And then I won you know 38 or 39 states. And won by the way, not by a little bit. Won with the highest vote in the history of the Republican Party. So just...Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. OK but John but the point is this, so it's a different kind of a campaign. But it's what I think is good. I think it's good. I think it's working here too.Question. But this aggressive counterprogramming the Democratic Convention is different than what we've seen in previous campaigns. And I'm wondering why you felt the need to make sure that everything that was said was responded to immediately with personal appearances, with campaign appearances while they were [inaudible]...Donald Trump. Well, when Joe Biden says that I want to firebomb the enemy, which was on television this morning, or carpet bomb. He used the term carpet bomb. When he makes the statement that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb, I never said that. That was Ted Cruz that said that OK? That was Ted Cruz, wasn't me.When Sanders, and I think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade. But when Bernie Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum wage, lower, it's a lie. So I have a choice. All my people say don't respond to it, it doesn't matter. I say to me it does matter. It matters.When people tell lies, politicians who tell lies very well, that's what they do, that's why they're politicians. But when politicians tell lies, and I'm lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone. In other words I can say that Biden lied when he said that. Or I can say that I didn't say that, Bernie Sanders. And you guys know that I didn't. In fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said it.So it's nice to be able to, President Obama said a year-and-a- half ago, Donald Trump will never be president. Today on ""The Today Show"" he said, this is democracy. A little bit different. Little bit different. [laughter]David, go ahead Dave.Question. Last night at the Democratic Convention [inaudible] women and gay advocates made strong cases that you and the Republican Party are kind of on the wrong side of history regarding abortion rights and gay marriage. Can you clarify your position on those?Donald Trump. You'll have to see it in the polls David. You know what my positions are. You'll have to see it at the polls.Question. I don't know what...[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Yeah go ahead.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. David my positions are down. You ask the question every single time. I give you an answer. My positions are down. Take a look. Go ahead.Question. Didn't you hold a Miss Universe Pageant—?Donald Trump. Yes I did.Question. Did Don Jr. say back in 2008 that there was Russian money pouring into the top organizations...Donald Trump. We wanted to, yeah, I don't know what he said. But we wanted...[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Excuse me, listen. We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia. It was a tremendous success. Very, very successful. And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia. And they wanted us to do it. But it never worked out.Frankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Yes ma'am go ahead.Question. [inaudible] President Obama has said that you would never win the presidency. Last night he said that anything is possible.Donald Trump. He did say that.Question. What is your reaction to that?Donald Trump. Well, I just said sort of said that. He just said that. He said it this morning, anything's possible. I think I'm going to win. I think people are sick and tired of incompetence. They're sick and tired of having politicians leading them down the tubes. Whether it's taxes, whether it's debt, whether it's any one of 15 different things. And that's why. I mean I think I'll win the election. I think you'll see that in the polls.All right a few more questions. Go ahead John.Question. Back in December...Donald Trump. I hope your arm's OK.Question. It's all right. Back in December sir you had said that you were probably going to be going to Israel to go and meet the leadership. Now that you are the Republican nominee, it is a tradition once you secure the Party's nomination, to do a trip...Donald Trump. Well, it's a tradition but I don't do things that are traditional. But I have great support from Israel. I will back Israel 100 percent. I would like to go there. But I have great relationships as you know, to the people in Israel.And by the way, Obama in my opinion is the single worst thing politically speaking that's ever happened to Israel. He has been a disaster for Israel.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. I don't know. I don't know. I haven't set my schedule yet. It could happen.Question. [inaudible] you are the nominee. Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders trying to build up a relationship should you win in November, that you don't have to hit the ground running [inaudible]?Donald Trump. No, I think we—it's possible we have. But I'm not—I'm only interested in winning. Once I win, I'll get along great with foreign leaders, but they won't be taking advantage. I mean, the problem we have with foreign leaders, whether it's China, Russia, or anybody, they don't respect our leadership. And certainly in the case of China, they take tremendous economic advantage of us—tremendous, to a point that is hard to believe.I'll get along great with the leadership. And we'll do well.Yes, ma'am, in the back?Question. Mr. Trump, [inaudible][crosstalk]Donald Trump. No, no. Excuse me. In the back?Question. I would like to know if you became president, would you recognize [inaudible] Crimea as Russian territory? And also if the U.S. would lift sanctions that are [inaudible]?Donald Trump. We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking.Go ahead.Question. Mr. Trump, [inaudible] questions. First, a quick one on the minimum wage. You said we need to raise it to $10. [inaudible] be clear here. Are you talking about the federal minimum wage?Donald Trump. Federal.Question. OK. Second question about [inaudible].Donald Trump. Right.Question. You said [inaudible]. Would religion be a part of the [inaudible]?Donald Trump. I'm not making it a part. But at some point, maybe people will change their minds, but as of right now, I'm not making it a part.OK.[crosstalk]Donald Trump. Yes, ma'am? Go ahead.Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. Who said that?Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. Who?Question. [inaudible]Donald Trump. I think President Obama has been the most ignorant president in our history. His views of the world, as he says, don't jive. And the world is a mess. You look at what's happening with the migration, with Syria, with Libya, with Iraq, with everything he's touched. He has been a disaster as a president. He will go down as one of the worst presidents in the history of our country. It is a mess.And I believe that Hillary Clinton will be even worse.Go ahead.Question. [inaudible] polls you [inaudible]. You just said [inaudible].Donald Trump. Oh, [inaudible] just said that? Many polls show that you are winning? I can't believe it. Are you Katy Turek of NBC? It's a disguise.Go ahead.[laughter]Question. Many polls show you [inaudible]. He said he feels that you are [inaudible] not prepared to be president. Can you [inaudible] lay out for us and for him what you do on a daily basis? How does your [inaudible]?Donald Trump. OK. Well, [inaudible].[crosstalk]Question. [inaudible] about what's going on [inaudible] and domestic affairs.Donald Trump. Sure. Well, you've been asking me a lot of questions for a lot of times. I've turned out to be right. I turned out to be right on NATO. After I said that on NATO, NATO changed their whole program because of me.Excuse me, Katy, Hillary Clinton said yesterday she's going to start renegotiating trade deals. She never said that in her life. She said it yesterday only because of me. I'm the one that's prepared. President Obama when he became president, he didn't know anything. This guy didn't know a thing. And honestly, today he knows less. Today, he knows less.He's done a terrible job. I think I'm very prepared.Now, with that being said, I've been a businessman all my life, but I've been watching it. I've been seeing it. I've been feeling. And as you know, I've been very much involved in politics from the other side. I understand politics or I guess I wouldn't be here. I mean, I beat a lot of very talented people.Question. [inaudible] advisers, though?Donald Trump. I do. I have great foreign advisers. And you have a list. And I gave you a list. And the other day, as an example, General Quinn and General Flynn, and we have so many—we have so many. As an example, I had a meeting three or four days ago, and I'm going to do a report on it, with seven or eight very, very talented advisers.Now, with all of that being said, a lot of people want the people that are doing it now; people that have certain names. Look at the mess they've gotten us into. They said, ""Have you spoken to so and so?"" Well, I said, but he was in favor of the war in Iraq many years ago, which I was not in favor of. ""Have you spoken to this one or that one?"" I said, they were all—look at the job they've done.So a lot of the people that you think are good because you know their name or because you see them on television, I don't think are good. Because look at the end result. The end result is our country is a mess. The Middle East has never been worse. Had we done nothing with the Middle East; had our presidents, with an ""S,"" gone to the beach and relaxed, we'd be in better shape than we are right now.All right, Tom. A couple more. Go ahead, Tom.Question. [inaudible] security briefings. You're about to get one.Donald Trump. Yeah.Question. Do you expect your opinion on [inaudible] or your opinion on [inaudible].Donald Trump. Well, we'll have to see. I mean, that's my opinion. That's my opinion. We'll have to see. I have a real problem when Hillary Clinton, who gives open access to a phony server, is allowed to get these briefings. How does Hillary Clinton get a national security briefing when she's been probably hacked, when so much of her information, the director of the FBI said it was essentially negligent. It was negligent.Now why are they giving her briefings, why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our country and our security, why are they giving Hillary Clinton briefings? Because it's going to get revealed. I mean her number one person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who's a sleazeball and a pervert. And I'm not saying that, I mean that's recorded history, right?I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets, OK? So how can Hillary Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldn't have had it and that they're missing 33,000 e-mails and that's just the beginning. So I don't think that I know at some point, they're going to be calling, they're going to want to brief me, but I'm not a talker about this stuff.I don't think that it's safe to have Hillary Clinton, in light of what just happened, and in light of what we just found out, I don't think it's safe to have Hillary Clinton be briefed on national security because the word will get out.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. No. He's not going to run for mayor. Oh, Don? He's not going to run for mayor. Don has no attention of running for mayor. But he did a great job the other night with his speech. Because he made a good speech, everyone says he should run for mayor. You know why? Because we have a Democratic mayor who's horrible, he's doing a horrible job, de Blasio. But Don is not going to run for—he has no interest in running for mayor.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes. Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Unbelievable what he said. I think it's disgraceful. Hillary Clinton, because of me, said that TPP is not going to happen. But we all know it is going to happen if she won. Terry McAuliffe said with a wink that if Hillary gets in, she's lying and it will happen. And there is nobody closer, I know this for a fact, there is nobody, including her own husband, closer to Hillary Clinton than Terry McAuliffe, OK? Go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Oh I don't know what he said, Jon, I really—Anthony Weiner's—look, look, look—Anthony Weiner is a proven loser. I mean the poor guy, he's locked up in a room. They lock him up in a room, they don't let him out. I don't know what Anthony—my son doesn't want to run for mayor. He has no intention of running for mayor.And besides that, as a Republican, you have a very tiny sliver in Manhattan, as you know, and in that area. It's almost impossible for a Republican to win. So, and my son likes to win, but my son has no intention of running for mayor so let's just put that to bed. Go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes, in [inaudible] very sad. Not [inaudible].Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Yes, I'm looking at it. I actually want to find out what causes it. It's a problem in many areas, OK? Yes, go ahead.Question. [off-mike]Donald Trump. Well, they shouted—you know what was interesting. Yesterday I made a speech in front of the great veterans as you saw, and it was very well received, she was there the day before. And when I started talking about Hillary Clinton, the veterans who saw her 24 hours before, started screaming, ""Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up."" They also screamed that, as you know, during the speech I made. The big speech.Donald Trump. And I said, ""Don't do that."" Now, I didn't do that for any reason. I really—I didn't like it. And they stopped. Not one reporter said that I said that. They all said—they started screaming ""Lock her up! Lock her up."" I said, ""Don't do that."" Nobody reported that I said that, because it's dishonest reporting.You do agree I said that, right?Question. You did say that.Donald Trump. OK. Well, why didn't somebody report that?Question. That's what I want to ask you about, you said you...Donald Trump. No, I think it's—I think it's a shame that they said it, but a lot of people would say that should happen.OK, one more question, yes—yes, ma'am, go ahead.Question. Yes, three weeks is a long time to wait for that [inaudible] immigration.This is Doral, it was built by...Donald Trump. Well, Doral is great. And Doral—I think I have over 1,000 Hispanics working at Doral, and they're doing a great job.Yes, ma'am, in the yellow, go ahead. Yellow.Question. I have another question.Donald Trump. Excuse me. Yellow.Question. Hillary Clinton's running mate...Donald Trump. Who?Question. Hillary Clinton's running mate speaks Spanish. Do you think this [inaudible] an advantage on...Donald Trump. No, I don't think it has any impact. He's been very bad—her running mate has been very, very bad on employment. And all you have to do is go to Virginia and speak to the people of Virginia, he has been so bad.I figured when she chose him, he was very popular in Virginia. They don't like him. They don't like him. It has been very close races, and his polling is very bad.So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I think it's time for Hillary Clinton to do a news conference, because it's almost a year now and it would be interesting to see how she does.Thank you all very much.Question. [inaudible] running for the president [inaudible]?Donald Trump. Might as well tell him to have a good time. He has done one bad job.OK, thank you, everybody."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio","Thank you, everybody, thank you very much. It's great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make America safe again. In the twentieth century, the United States has defeated fascism, Nazism and communism. Now, a different threat faces our world: radical Islamic terrorism. This summer, there's been an ISIS attack launched outside the warzones of the Middle East--hard to believe--every eighty-four hours. Here in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another: thirteen were murdered and thirty-eight wounded in the assault on Fort Hood. The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed sixty-four people, and ultimately left five dead, including two of our great police officers . In Chattanooga, Tennessee, five unarmed Marines--unbelievable people, by the way--were shot and killed at a military recruiting center. Last September, fourteen innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino; another twenty-two were very gravely injured. In June, forty-nine Americans were executed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando . Another fifty-three were badly injured. It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack, by far, the worst on the LGBTQ community, and I'll tell you what: we can never, ever allow this to happen again. [applause] In Europe--thank you--in Europe we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed afflicted upon our closest allies. In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. Twelve were killed, including two police officers, and 11 were wounded. Two days later, four were murdered in a Jewish delicatessen. In November of 2015 terrorist went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368 people, some in very, very, very bad shape today. France is suffering gravely. And the tourism industry is being massively affected in the most negative way. In March of this year terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport killing 32 and injuring 340 people. This July in the South of France an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder, plowing down and killing 85 men, women and children and wounding 308 people.Terrible. Among the dead were two Americans, a Texas father and his 11-year-old son. A few weeks ago in Germany a refugee armed with an axe wounded 5 people in a gruesome train attack. Only days ago an ISIS killer invaded a Christian Church in Normandy, France forced an 85- year-old priest to his knees. A priest who was beloved, who was beloved; before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things.Overseas ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another. Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings, and drownings, ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution. Holy sites desecrated. Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination. ISIS rounding up what it calls 'Nation of the Cross', 'Nation of the Cross' in a campaign of absolute and total genocide.We cannot let this evil continue. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. Nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam, it's oppression of women, gays, children and non-believers be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries. [applause] We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we've faced at every age and before. But we will not, we will not, remember this, defeat it with closed eyes or silenced voices. We have a president that doesn't want to say the words. Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [applause] Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president. [applause] The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton. Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama-Clinton administration took over. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States.Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.Fast forward to today. What we have--and think of this--and the decisions made by the Obama/Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous.Libya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other really brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations.Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways of the world. Iraq is in chaos. And ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West.In 2014, ISIS was operating in seven nations. They were in seven nations. Terrible, but that's what it was.Today they're fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more for a total of 24. And many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries. They don't even know.The situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. A new congressional report reveals that the Administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS with 40 percent of analysts saying they had experience efforts to manipulate their findings in trying to make it look much better than it is. It's bad.At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and to the United States. Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is not flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States. Plus if you remember from two weeks ago, another $400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom.Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran, which chants, ""death to America"", in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring a dominant world power.It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama's global apology tour. We all remember. We all remember. [Booing] In a series of speeches, President Obama described America as arrogant, dismissive, derisive, and a colonial power. He was describing us.He informed other countries that he would be speaking up about America's past errors. He pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms. He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes, and described Guantanamo Bay as a rallying cry for our enemies.Perhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obama's speech to the Muslim world, delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009. I remember it well.In winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the USSR the Evil Empire. Yet when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found. Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record--and remember this, our human rights--and theirs. The records are unbelievable and unmistakable. His naive words were followed by even more naive actions. The failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in Iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS without question. [applause] The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton's disaster, total disaster, in Libya. President Obama has since said that he regrets, and really regrets, Libya and the mistake he made. He considers it his worst mistake. According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton's forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor. That's why we went in. With one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton's policies launched ISIS onto the world stage. Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country. The Middle East in particular. The Clintons made almost $60,000 in gross income while she was secretary of state. It is unbelievable. Incident after incident proves again and again Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment--as said by Bernie Sanders--stability and temperament and the moral character to lead our nation. [applause] Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face. Not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around. [applause] It is now time for a new approach. Our current strategy of nation- building and regime-change is a proven, absolute failure. We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning. A major difference between me and my opponent. Though I was a private citizen whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion. I was against, believe me.Three months before the invasion I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery, that ""perhaps we shouldn't be doing it yet. And that the economy is a much bigger problem.""In August of 2004, very early, right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire Magazine in an interview. Here's the quote in full. ""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess we're in. I would never have handled it that way."" This was right after the invasion. ""Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? C'mon.""I then continued, ""Two minutes after we leave there's going to be a revolution and the meanest, toughest, smartest most viscous guy, in this case, guy, will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have. ""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side. The tremendous damage done. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All of this death and destruction for nothing.""So I've been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in. But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.After we had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal on a timetable advertised to our enemies. They said, we're moving out, here's our time, here's our date. Who would do this but an incompetent president?Al Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated. And Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world. By that same token President Obama and Hillary Clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt. One more point on this. I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq. [applause] I said it over and over and over again. Another area where my judgment has been proven correct. I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed, keep the oil, keep the oil. According to CNN, ISIS made as much as $500,000 in oil sales in 2014 alone. That's before they really got started. Fueling and funding its reign of terror. If we had controlled the oil like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S. forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil. I was saying this constantly and consistently to whomever would listen. I said, ""Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Don't let somebody else get it."" [applause] If they had listened to me then we would have had the economic benefits of the oil which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war. [applause] In addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved. This proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets. We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils. [applause] Instead, all we got from Iraq and our ventures in the Middle East, was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss. But it's time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course. [applause] If I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end. [applause] Thank you. Our new approach--which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East--must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally. Very important. Some don't share this goal. We cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies. [applause] As president, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal. We will work side by side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally Israel. [applause] We will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan and the president of Egypt, President Sisi, and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished. [applause] We will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats. Very good. Very, very good.I also believe that we could find common ground with Russia in a fight against ISIS. Wouldn't that be a good thing? Wouldn't that be a good thing? [applause] They, too, have much at stake in the outcome in Syria, and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism just as bad as ours. They have a big, big problem in Russia with ISIS.My administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS. International cooperation to cut off their funding. Expanded intelligence sharing, and cyber warfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting. Their recruiting is taking place right now, and they're setting records. It's got to be stopped. [applause] We cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy. We must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do it immediately--immediately. [applause] Unlike Hilary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless of handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are. [applause] And by the way, what's happened with her 33,000 e-mails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America. [applause] I've often said that the great General Douglas MacArthur and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to recklessly announce their every move before it happens. Like they did in Iraq, so that the enemy can prepare and adapt. Their enemy says, ""Thank you.""The fight will not be limited to ISIS. We will decimate Al- Qaeda. And we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah. [applause] So important. We can use existing U.N. Security Council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions. Military, cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism.But we must use ideological warfare as well. Very important. And they use it on us, better than we have ever even thought of using it on them. But that will change. Just as we won, just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam. While my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death, my administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different beliefs. [applause] Our administration would be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices. This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings. Over 1,000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year. Recently a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family. In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said, ""Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions."" Shockingly, this is a tradition that has reached our own shores. One such case, and many, many cases have happened--where one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter, claiming she had been ""too Westernized."" To defeat Islamic terrorism we must also speak our forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow. It's a breeding ground. It's a terrible, terrible breeding ground. A new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well. [applause] The common thread linking the major Islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred on our soil--9/11, the Fort Hood shooting, the Boston bombing, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando attack--is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants. Clearly, new screening procedures are needed. A review by the U.S. Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between 9/11 and 2014, and many more since then, and this year is a record for identification. It's gotten worse, far worse. We also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country, as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota. Beyond terrorism, as we have also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them. In Cologne, Germany on New Years, we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows. Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large number of immigrants--extreme views about religion such death penalty--and for those who are involved--the death penalty is very, very common if you don't have the faith that they demand you have.A Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough, and we will be even extreme. [applause] We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme--extreme vetting. Our country has enough problems. We don't need more, and these are problems like we've never had before. [applause]] In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles, or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. [applause] Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country. [applause] Only those who we expect to flourish in our country, and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas. [applause] To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world, that have a history of exporting terrorism, nor for us! Not for us. [applause]Thank you. Thank you. As soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place, there are many such regions. We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume, based on new circumstances or new procedures. The size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening. [applause] We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year . Beyond that, we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions--hundreds of thousands . If we don't control the numbers, we can't perform adequate screening. There's no way it can take place. [applause]By contrast, my opponent wants to increase--which is unbelievable, no matter who you are, where you come from--wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% over what they are now. [Boos] The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary's plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term , assuming no cuts to other refugee programs--so it could get worse! This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers. The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department's placement figures. Think of this: $400 billion. In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel. [Boos] And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe. We have enough problems in our country. We don't need more.Lastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures. Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. The 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications. Almost every one of them. It said practically in big bold letters ""fraud"". And nobody saw it. The Russians warned us about the Boston bombers, here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI. Very sad. The female San Bernardino shooter, on her--on her statements, and everything that she said: she was here on a fiancée visa, which most people have not even heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to support very openly jihad online. These are the people we're taking in. A neighbor saw suspicious behavior--bombs on the floor, and other things--but didn't warn authorities because they said they didn't want to be accused of racial profiling. Now, many are dead and many more are gravely wounded. The shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11 . He, too, was interviewed by the FBI. His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime, and expressed anti-American views very strongly , and by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face, all the way through her speech. [Boos] He obviously liked what she had to say. It's called: weakness, weakness. It's called stupidity, and we've had it. [applause]The Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another. He even proclaimed that we ""love death more then you love life"". Not good. These warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. That is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam, which will include reformers voices in the Muslim community, who will hopefully work with us. We want to build bridges and erase divisions. The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization. This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners. And while I'm at it, we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. We will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence. Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations. [applause] Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions. [applause] Finally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support to terrorism. There will be consequences for those people. There will be very serious consequences. [applause] Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country. [applause] To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission. The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed, one-by-one, viciously if necessary--viciously if necessary. Immigration offices will also have their powers restored. Those have been taken away. Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they don't immediately, we will return them home.To make America safe again, we must work together again. Our victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus. That is what we must have to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. [applause] But just like we couldn't defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists, or explaining its horrible evils, we can't defeat radical Islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing. We have to explain that it exists, and explain the difficulties. We have to have a leader that can do that, and we do not have that now. But this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life. We have an exceptional country, an exceptional way of life. But it's being tread on by sick, sick people. And expecting that as newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and do the same. Pride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those that come into our society and want to join our society. [applause] Assimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion. Our system of government and our American culture is the best in the world, and we'll produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. This approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country. Renewing the spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country, of which there are so many. We have a divider as president. We call him the Great Divider. It's the thing he best. [applause] It will do so by emphasizing what we have in common, not what pulls us apart. This is my pledge to the American People: as your president, I will be your single greatest champion. I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. [applause] We will reject bigotry and hatred, and oppression, in all of its ugly forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American People. Only this way will we make America great again, and safe again--for everyone. Thank you very much, God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]"
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at the Washington County Fair Park in West Bend, Wisconsin","It's so great to be here tonight. I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Priebus, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.We are at a decisive moment in this election.Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country. Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism. Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness. Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.Law and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods. It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one. The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives – whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore – and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.During the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded. More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began.How are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?The war on our police must end. It must end now.The war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor. Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school.For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night. My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.I care too much about my country to let that happen.We all care too much about our country to let that happen.Good policing saves lives. My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this. The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.Imagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn't blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City? I'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.It's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force. I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.Hillary Clinton has had her chance. She failed. Now it's time for new leadership.The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people. It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American – and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.I am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.It is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade. Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings. 18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims. The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average. Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job. Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty. 55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it's one of the worst public school systems in the country.1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.To every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted. They've just assumed they'll get your support and done nothing in return for it. It's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it's time to rebuild the inner cities of America – and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.I'm not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me. I've been paying my own way. The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.The other party – the Democratic Party – nominated the personification of special interest corruption. The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.I am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help. The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.Jobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation.We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future. She doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.The African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party. It's time to break with the failures of the past – I want to offer Americans a new future.It is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton. The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.Insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.When we talk about the insider, who are we talking about? It's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests. It's the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill. It's the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition out of existence. The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.Every day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and you hear about some self-interest banker or some discredited Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.I wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.The leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.I am going to give the people their voice back.Think about it. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.The people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?Aren't you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?Are you ready for change?Are you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first?Let's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America. It's time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests. I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system – a lot of people who've created our problems – will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.It's time to stop making the special interests rich. It's time to make the American people rich.I am going to Make America Wealthy again.The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.They've ruined the schools.They've driven out the jobs.They've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.Violent crime has risen 17% in America's 50 largest cities last year. Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent. Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.This is the future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same. The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.It is time for a different future.Here is what I am proposing.First, on immigration. No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community. Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans. I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.On trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.On taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores – and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee. Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.On education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first.Hillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.I am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.On crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods. To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.On healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare – which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases – and give choice to patients and consumers. Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out – as are many of the major insurance companies.On government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government. We've seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense. We've seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning.We are going to make this a government of the people once again. This is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you. The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.These are tough times. But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.To do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.I will be your fighter.To defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina. Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina. She cannot win for you.Most importantly, she has bad judgment. Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.The only individuals she's ever delivered for is her donors – not the people.I've said it before, and I'll say it again. My opponent asks her supporters to repeat a three-word pledge. Her pledge reads: ""I'm With Her""I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: ""I'm With You – the American people.""I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.Together, We will make America strong again.We will make American safe again.And we will make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at the Charlotte Convention Center in Charlotte, North Carolina","I'd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.We are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt – and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.We are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.Tonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.On Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.On Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.Let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.The chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end – and it will end very quickly.Every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.To be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.We cannot make America great again if we leave any community behind.Nearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.Jobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.But to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct – it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need – and so many are not making it. They are dying.I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans – Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals – who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.Fourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.Every day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight ofour lives – together – to save our country.I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.Our whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.When I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.In the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.If something isn't working, you replace it.If a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.That's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always – and I mean always – come first.Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?Aren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.Aren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?That is all about to change – and it's about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.I've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.And, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.I have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign – nobody else is.My only interest is the American people.So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.The American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.Tell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?Has Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?Has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?Has she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?Has she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?Has Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?Speaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don't pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages – openly and blatantly – just like he lied about Obamacare.Now the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. Hillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.Let's talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.Bill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization – another Hillary Clinton-backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State – our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.Hillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.Another major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.I've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?Where was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?These moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don't get apologies. They'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.But they will always come first to me.Listen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.Hillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.Please remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.Instead, I will be a champion for the people.The establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed – she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.Just imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools. Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.Instead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders. It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.So many people suffering in silence. No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.So again, it's not about me. It's never been about me. It's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.I am running to be their voice.I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.I am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again – including some powerful people in my own party. Because it means I am fighting for real change.There's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.The insiders fighting for the insiders.I am fighting for you.Here is the change I propose.On terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.We will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.On immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people. Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa. If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.We will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.My opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration. Hillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.We have enough problems already, we don't need another one.On crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world. We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.The gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one. Their day is over.On trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.Hillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.On taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses – creating millions of new good paying jobs.We are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.On education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones. My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.We are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities – and what a big difference that will make. This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.On healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare – at a much lower cost.On political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.Finally, we are going to bring this country together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.If African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing. Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership – look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working. It is time for change.What do you have to lose by trying something new? – I will fix it. This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.In my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.But we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.It is time to vote for a New American Future.Together, We will make America strong again.We will make American proud again.We will make America safe again.Friends and fellow citizens: Come November, we will make America great again.Thank You, and God Bless."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at Luedecke Arena in Austin, Texas","On November 8th, we are going to declare our independence from special interests, corrupt politicians, and from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders.We are going to declare our independence from media executives that don't care about us, and politicians who don't listen to us.We are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty and crushing debt.We are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.Once again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.It's going to be America First from now on.Let me tell you what this new future looks like.We are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs.We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.We are going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.We are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment.We will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility, or with the private doctor of their choice.We're going to eliminate job-killing regulations.We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.Let's talk about another issue that is important to our future, and the future of our children.That's the issue of crime. Violent crime is rising across the country. More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year.No American should consider this level of crime acceptable. Every American has the right to live in safety and peace.A Trump Administration is going to restore law and order.Let me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers. This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers, and the wounding of another 7, in the assault on Dallas. We pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded.To all law enforcement in America: we are with you, we support you, and we will always stand with you.Together, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land – but especially those who have not known safety in a very, very long time.That includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law.I will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people.I will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear.All citizens deserve to be protected. No American left behind.I want every African-American parent in this country – and all parents in this country – to be able to raise their kids in safety.And I want to ensure every African-American child in this country – and all children in this country – are put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.We are going to have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers. My opponent, Hillary Clinton, discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy.No one owns me. I answer only to the American people.In a New York Post column, Deroy Murdock, published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities. Murdock confirms these facts:""The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent — down 3.2 percent.This metric also slumped for black teenagers, from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent — down 6.4 percent.The percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014 — up 1.6 percent.The number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama — from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014 — up 58.2 percent.Also, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent, the Census reports — down 9.5 percent.""Nearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty. 58 percent of young African Americans are not employed.Homicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore. Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities.This is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.To those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?Let me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs, higher wages, and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities.We are going to turn it all around. Success must be created for everyone, and available to everyone.That is how we are going to create a New American Future.But to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all: Border Security.We are going to build a wall.We are going to enforce the law.We are going to protect your jobs and wages.And we are going to keep our country safe.According to the Texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft.Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a totally, completely open border.She wants catch-and-release.Obamacare for illegal immigrants.Massive amnesty in her first 100 days.She wants to gut immigration enforcement.She supports Sanctuary Cities.She wants to let people overstay their visas without removal.One lawless order after another.We must not let it happen.Hillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider.I want to create safe zones in the Middle East. My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening, and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values. After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about.This election will decide whether or not we have a border.This election will decide whether or not we have a country.Today I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports. Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories.These are all forgotten Americans – they are not Hollywood or media stars, or big money special interest donors.She is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests.This corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy. Every day more and more alarming facts come out.The scandal I speak of is the State Department's Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton.If our Secretary of State can be bought, or bribed, or sell or trade government favors, then the whole American system is threatened.It is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself. This is what happens in a Third World country – it's the failed conditions people flee when they come to America.America can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash.The new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.Hillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes. That's why she deleted 33,000 emails. That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public.She said she never sent or received classified materials.That was a lie, proved over and over again.She claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device. But she used multiple devices.Another lie.Under penalty of perjury, she said she turned over all of her work-related emails. But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another 15,000 more.Another Clinton lie.She said she sent nothing marked classified.A total lie, unmasked to the world. And more to come.She said her server was secure, and had no breaches. But we know now it was completely unsecure, and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies.More Clinton lies.Clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them.One more Hillary Clinton lie.Lie after lie after lie.Hillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office.It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons' set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.It goes back to the Arkansas days, and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors.But once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business – or, more accurately, their crime enterprise – grew with the roles reversed. Bill, now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator, Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President. They turned this into an exponentially larger business.But it was more than a business, it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise. It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States.The e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same. If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton, you got an entry to the Department of State. Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.Today a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills. She was Secretary of State Clinton's Chief of Staff. You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business. But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation – no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages.We also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation.This creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech. I walked through two of them yesterday – the sale of U.S. Uranium to Russia, and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech.The UBS saga is another one. Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans.She negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement. Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450 accounts. Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual.Before her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60,000 to the Foundation. After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton.This is corruption, pure and simple.This is why I have called for a special prosecutor.Justice is supposed to be blind. It's never supposed to be for sale.In the long-run, there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J. Trump.Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.You will be voting for justice, fairness and equality.You will also be voting for a more inclusive country, where no one is left out.Another 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama. The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.Our pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation. I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty.We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.The era of division is coming to end. We will create a new future of American unity.Are you ready for real American change?It is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans.We will promote our common culture, values and principles.We will be one nation.We will be one people.We will share together one great future.It's going to be America First.Together, we will make America proud again.We will make America prosperous again.We will make America safe again.Friends, citizens and fellow Americans: We will make America great again."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks to the American Legion in Cincinnati, Ohio","Thank you all so much. What an honor and a privilege to speak today to the American Legion.I thank Commander Dale Barnett, your vice commanders, and your constitutional officers. You have all done such an incredible job.The men and women of the American Legion represent the best of America. Strength, courage, selfless devotion. Your organization, and its members, have done so much to defend our country, our flag, and to advance the cause of Americanism – not Globalism.We are in your debt.I will never let you down.Together, we are going to work on so many shared goals. But I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you: promoting American pride and patriotism in America's schools.In A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America's children. We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America's history, its institutions, and its heroes.We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.We will be united by our common culture, values and principles – becoming One American Nation.One country, under one constitution, saluting one American Flag.The flag all of you helped to protect and preserve.That flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag – and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.In addition to teaching respect for the flag, we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries.We will rebuild our depleted military, and pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense. We will do it based on those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.We will make sure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have the best equipment, training and tools in the world – and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world, both in service, and when they return home as civilians.That will require a total reform of the Veterans Administration.I've laid out a ten-step VA reform plan you can review on my website. Here are the basics:I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the VA.The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our veterans – not bureaucrats, not politicians, but veterans.I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline anyone who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust.I will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system.We are going to ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care, including the best care in the world for our female veterans.The Veterans health system will remain a public system, because it is a public trust. But never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care.That means Veterans will have the right to go to a VA facility, or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice – whatever is fastest and best for the veteran. The Veteran will be in control.Should I have the honor of serving as president, we are also going to start facing the world with confidence again. We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security – and our border.I just came back from a great meeting with the President of Mexico, where I expressed my deep respect for the people of his country, and for the tremendous contributions of Mexican-Americans in our country – including to our Armed Services.I want to again thank him for his gracious hospitality, and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both of our countries.We agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.We also talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere. A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings, and a better market for products made in the United States.When I am President, I am going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect American jobs and create new opportunities for American workers. We will fight for every last American job.We're going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing American economy looks like.We are going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores – and unleash an American Energy Revolution.We will also be appointing justices who will defend our Constitution.I will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of Antonin Scalia, judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and not just make it up.Above all, these next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the United States and our friends and allies. We are going to end the era of nation-building, and create a new foreign policy – joined by our partners in the Middle East – that is focused on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic Terrorism. We will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.At the same time, we will change our immigration screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country. That includes stopping the influx of Syrian refugees. My opponent wants a 550% increase. I, on the other hand, want to build a safe zone overseas – and use the money saved to invest in America.It is time to create a New American Future – for you, your children, and all American children yet to come.In this future, we will have an honest government – and that includes an honest State Department, not Pay-For-Play. Government access and favors will no longer be for sale, and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally bleached.We will also have an efficient and responsible federal budget – no more waste, no more throwing away taxpayer dollars.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.It will be an inclusive society, one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country – including our inner cities. We will ensure that every child in this land, including African-American and Hispanic child, is put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a great job.We will follow the noble example of our military men and women, working selflessly across all difference races and incomes and backgrounds, to achieve unity and accomplish amazing things.Ladies and gentlemen of the American Legion, I ask today for the honor of your vote. Working in unison, we can deliver the real American change our country so desperately needs.We will make America Strong Again.We will Make America Proud Again.We will Make America Safe Again.We will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God bless."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at the Roberts Centre in Wilmington, Ohio","It's so great to be back in Ohio.Come November, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House – and we are going to bring back your jobs.We are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.We are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation. We are going to stop the foreign cheating.The era of economic surrender is over.A new era of American Greatness is beginning.No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.Hillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, she backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.One bad deal after another.Hillary Clinton's donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. This subtracts directly from our growth – our economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.I am promising a new legacy for America.We are going to create a New American Future.But to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.Hillary Clinton, who called the TPP the ""Gold Standard"", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.We won't let that happen.We will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.We will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.It's going to be America First.My economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.Here are a few of the things we will do:A massive tax cut for working Americans.We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration's new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.Hillary Clinton says she wants to ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.We are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work – and we are going to get your energy bills down.We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.We are going to create jobs for all of our people, and we are going to fight to ensure that every young African-American and Latino child is put on the ladder of American success: a good education, and a great job.Another major part of our agenda is immigration security. We need to protect American jobs. We need to protect American safety.Last night, I outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs, safety and security to the American people with bold new immigration reforms.I had a great meeting yesterday with the President of Mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border, put the cartels out of business, and to keep jobs in our hemisphere.Let's also talk about government corruption.No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.Here is one example of Clinton Corruption.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians. Clinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.Here is another example of pay-for-play.In 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments – including Sudan, Syria, and Iran. Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.In June 2011, Hillary Clinton's state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.During that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 – his highest paying speech.In April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria –but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran.A Trump Administration will end the government corruption.No one will be above the law.We will have one set of rules for everyone. In Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her – and another set of rules for everyone else.I am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. The forgotten men and women of America.I am your voice.Hillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.My campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.We are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values.My tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill.My trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers.My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.My regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.My promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities. Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.My government reforms will make your voice heard – not the voice of the special interests.Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.Insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.I wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make American Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at Great Faith International Ministries in Detroit, Michigan","Thank you. That's so nice. Thank you.Well, that's so nice. And, Bishop Jackson, I want to thank you and Dr. Jackson and you have some voice, I have to say. Incredible. And some spirit, some spirit. Talent.""Thank you. Well, I just wrote this the other day knowing I'd be here. And, I mean it from the heart and I'd like to just read it and I think you'll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways.""For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country. So true. It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the Civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. It's from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character, a deeper concern for mankind, and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together. And we're bound together and I see that today. This has been an amazing day for me.""The African-American faith community has been one of God's greatest gifts to America and to its people. There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the Black churches and church-goers. You do right everyday by your community and your families. You raise children in the Light of God; I will always support your church, always. And defend your right to worship . . . so important.""I am here today to listen to your message and I hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought. I can tell you that.""Christian faith is not the past but the present and the future. Make it stronger. And we'll open it up to great, great leaders like Pastor Jackson, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Jackson, and so many others. And so many others actually sitting here. Darrell Scott, who is phenomenal, who has been with me for so long. So long. Omrosea, who is a very nice person and I don't want to say that. Because I'll destroy her image by saying that. She's actually a very, very fine person and pastor. And I want to thank all the folks and there is somebody that's been very special to me, Dr. Ben Carson who's been . . . Stand up, Ben. Come here, come here. Come here, Ben. This is a great man and great guy.""So, as I prepare to campaign all across the nation, and in every community, I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change. Which will be so good for Detroit and so good for this community because we're going to bring jobs back. I will have a chance . . . Thank you. We're bringing them back. We're taking them from Mexico and everywhere else because they're gone.""I will have a chance to discuss school choice. Its very important. And how to put every American on the ladder of success. A great education, a great job. But today, I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you and I have been doing that. And we had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson. It was really an amazing interview. He is better than the people who do that professionally. I will tell you. It's true. It's true. It's true. He's better.""And I didn't really know what I was getting into. I didn't know. Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild? He's a great gentleman and a very smart guy. I just hope you don't lose him to Hollywood. That's the only problem. And especially, and especially Dr. Jackson, she may be gone. Hollywood is calling. Look at all those television cameras back there. Look at all the television cameras. I'm sorry to do that to you, Bishop. Because, it's just one of those things, right?""Our nation is too divided. We talk past each other, not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on. They don't know. They have no clue. I'm here today to learn. So that we can together remedy injustice, in any form. And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways.""Our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself. I want to reform that system so that it works for you, everyone in this room. I believe true reform can only come from outside the system. I really mean that. Being a businessman is much different than being a politician because I understand what is happening. And we are going outside the establishment.""Becoming the nominee of the Party of Abraham Lincoln — a lot of people don't realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican — has been the greatest honor of my life. It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the Party but more important the future of the country and the community.""I believe that we need a Civil Rights agenda for our time. One that ensures the rights to a great education — so important — and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job. A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning. That can happen. We need to bring our companies back.""It also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights, really fights for our jobs. I want to help you build and rebuild Detroit. And we can do that especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. I mean that. It's been an amazing experience. It's been an amazing experience. Really.""Nothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential, tremendous potential. I met some people this morning that are incredible people and they're looking for jobs. These are incredible people . . . young people. Our whole country loses out when we're unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks""We're one nation and when anyone hurts, we all hurt together. That is so true. So true.""We're all brothers and sisters and we're all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together. All together.""I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right. I want America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that. We can do that again.""Factories everywhere, new roads and bridges, new schools — especially schools — and new hope.""I have been so greatly blessed, and in so many ways, with no greater blessing than my family. I've had a great family.""Nothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling all over the world — I've sort of seen a lot — to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before. And that's many, many people in Detroit.""When I see wages falling, people out of work, I know the hardships this inflicts and I am determined to do something about it. I will do something about it. I do get things done, I will tell you. Some people have strengths, that's one of my strengths, I get things done. I'm going to get things done for you.""Please know this, for any who are hurting, things are going to turn around.Tomorrow will be better. Much better. The Pastor and I were talking about, riding up the street, how we see all those closed stores and people sitting down on the sidewalk, and no jobs, and no activity. We'll get it turned around. We'll get it turned around, Pastor. Believe me.""We're going to win again as a country and we're going to win again for all of our people. I want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong. America has been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. So important. People have no idea how important they are.""Now, in these hard times for our country, let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. I am so deeply grateful to be here today and it is my prayer that the America of tomorrow — and I mean that — that the America oftomorrow will be one of unity, togetherness, and peace. And perhaps we can add the word prosperity. Ok? Prosperity.""I'd like to conclude with a passage from 1 John, Chapter 4. You know it? See, most groups I speak to don't know that. But we know it. If you want, we can say it together: 'No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and His love is made complete in us.' And that is so true.""Thank you very much. This has been such an honor. Thank you very much. Bishop, thank you sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."""
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at a Rally at the Greenville Convention Center in Greenville, North Carolina","Thank you. It's great to be back in North Carolina.In 62 days, we are going to win this state – and we are going to win the White House.This is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal.This is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years.For how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests?This is the year we can finally fix it.That's because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system.We will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.We will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems.So to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over – your moment of liberation is at hand. A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy, to heal our economy, and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country.The change will begin my first day in office.First, we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land.Then, we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border. This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs, as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth.But that's just the beginning.I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Under Senate rules, that bill can be passed with 51 votes – meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican President can save Americans from this disaster in a single afternoon.It's going to be a very busy first day.I am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region. My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. She is running to be America's Angela Merkel.I am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so. This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will enforce it.The Secretary of State is required to take this action, but Hillary Clinton refused to do so – resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S. communities.Furthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed – this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy.I will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified. We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina.Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the TPP. She just does whatever her donors tell her to do.In a Trump Administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers – not on behalf of global corporations.We will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets – and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First.Crucially, I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS. Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission.For years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C. The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton.I am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how to win – and know how to keep us out of endless war.Today, 88 retired U.S. generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement.That's one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton. She favors what has been called military adventurism – rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families, then inviting the refugees into our country – creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS.I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability – instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history.We will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism.We will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton – her legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before.As part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we are going to rebuild our depleted military. This is the ultimate deterrent.We will be guided by those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.I will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately re-invest in our military. Right now, we have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one of the smallest Navy's since 1917.Like the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security.We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential.The new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office. If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn't even get a security clearance.Her conduct is disqualifying.Let's run through what we discovered in those FBI documents. It's important, and we're hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall.It's clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information. She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn't understand that the letter ""C"" meant confidential in the documents she emailed.On 39 separate occasions she said she couldn't recall details about her mishandling of classified information, and she couldn't even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn't get into her server. Keep in mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program.It's also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions. After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery, called BleachBit.They used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn't be turned over later – and by the way, who uses 12 different phones in 4 years? The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very shady activity.People who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law.Hillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton's private attorney.Hillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldn't recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times – and that's in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th.No one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes.Hillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors.It's called pay-for-play.One example of pay-for-play is what the Clinton's did in Haiti. Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country. We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake.But while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have cashed in.Bill and Hillary's brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti, and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company.Clinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments.In one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti.The facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft.People are asking: where did all the money go?This November, it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places.One of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton's policies are African-Americans. She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future.Many African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country, we will honor and protect their achievements. That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent.But millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools.The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.4 in 10 African-American children in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.58% of African-American youth are not working.2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Nationwide, African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22.This is a national crisis – and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States.To those suffering in crime and poverty, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change? We are going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice. I will never, ever, ever take you for granted.We are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda. We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs.This weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson. It was an incredible and deeply moving experience.I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Let me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4: ""No one has ever seen God; but, if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.""Imagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans – and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.We will keep our children safe – which requires secure borders, a strong military, and supporting law enforcement.Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Government corruption will end – and the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton's donors.Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at the Union League of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Today, I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy: Peace Through Strength.We want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.I am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America's core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world. This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.I'm proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win – and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now. Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.In a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism. The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.Gradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission. We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare – as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.Instead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world – just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.We will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.At the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.These are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.Unlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction. Hillary Clinton's legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering. Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.Including Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner. Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton's policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent. Russia has defied this Administration at every turn. Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.Sometimes it has seemed like there wasn't a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn't want to invade, intervene or topple. She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.Hillary Clinton is just reckless – so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack. Then Clinton's team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails. They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice. These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.In the FBI report, she claimed she couldn't recall important information on 39 occasions.She can't even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn't even know the letter ""C"" means confidential.If she can't remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.Her conduct is simply disqualifying.She talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton's only foreign policy experience is ""failure."" Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.Libya was stable.Syria was under control.Egypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.Fast-forward to today. What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. And hundreds of thousands are dead.In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.ISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States – plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments. In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.Worst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.This is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.But that's not all. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.Under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II. We currently have the smallest Army since 1940. The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915. And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.When Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships. When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships. Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.The average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old. We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers – their fathers flew the same plane.Our Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.In 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines. Today, it's just 182,000.Our ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions. President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troops—which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.It takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.In 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.In the current year, we are spending $548 billion – a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars. This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts. Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts – even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.This will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.As part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending. In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks – and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.Government-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.We can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition – that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.We can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law. Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws. Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.The military will not be exempt either – the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.Early in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now. Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.Additionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.Finally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy. The Institute for Energy Research cites a ""short-run"" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.Using these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:We will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army's chief of staff has said he needs. We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.We will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies – we have 23 now.We will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel – we have 276 ships now.And we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions – we have 1,113 now.We will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.Under Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea. As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.We propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.Accomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort —every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow.In addition, we will improve the Department of Defense's cyber capabilities. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.Which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.Hillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department. Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.One of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities – in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure. I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities. At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.These new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.America must be the world's dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans – including in our inner cities – should get these new jobs.We must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families – both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.To all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.We will protect those who protect us.And we will follow their example of unity. We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.Together, we will have one great American future.We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.America will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.We will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.We will bring back our jobs.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at the Cleveland Arts and Social Sciences Academy in Cleveland, Ohio","Thank you. It's great to be here today.In particular, I want to thank Mr. Ron Packard and Ms. Deborah Mays for hosting me at their school.Today, we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign: school choice.But before we do, I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clinton's emails. According to the FBI report: ""The FBI did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact, and, in doing so, obtained emails sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account.""Remember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program – among many other extremely sensitive matters.This is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief. By the way, the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night, where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism, and made us less safe than ever before.Throughout it all, she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State. These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia, doing favors for UBS bank, and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.It's all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation.As part of her criminal cover-up, Hillary Clinton's staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena. Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer.Then, when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn't remember important events 39 times. She couldn't even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information. She even said she didn't know that the letter ""C"" stood for confidential classified information.All the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests, the world fell apart. Hillary Clintons' policies produced ruin in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. She failed in Russia, in China, in North Korea.Her policies unleashed ISIS, spread terrorism, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons – not to mention the ransom payments.On top of it all, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She's raced to invade, intervene, and topple regimes. She believes in globalism, not Americanism.Last night, she even falsely said no American died in Libya. Then she also falsely said there's no ground troops in Iraq, even though we have 5,000 military personnel there right now.Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race. I opposed going in, and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out – letting ISIS fill the void.But I was opposed to the war from the beginning.Long after Howard Stern, but three months before the Iraq war started, I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, that ""perhaps [we] shouldn't be doing it yet,"" and that ""the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.""Then, On March 25th of 2003, just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is ""a mess,"" yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.In July of 2003, I said that ""I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly."" I had a number of quotes to this effect.Then, in August of 2004, very early in the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine.""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.What was the purpose of the whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!I would have been tougher on terrorism. Bin Laden would have been caught long ago.""Had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition. For years, I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clinton's failed career.Here is the bottom line: I was a private citizen. I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had. But in Iraq, my judgement was right and hers was wrong.Hillary Clinton is always complaining about what's wrong, but she's been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it – all you have to do is look at New York State, when she was a Senator. All talk, but nothing happened.We're on track to spend $6 trillion altogether on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Meanwhile, massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepair.It's time to rebuild America.Too many Americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the American Dream.We are one nation, and when any part of our country hurts – our whole country hurts.My goal as President will be to ensure that every child in this nation – African-American, Hispanic-American, all Americans – will be placed on the ladder of success: a great education, and a great job.That ladder rests on a fundamental foundation: safety.In order to help our children succeed, our first duty is to ensure that every kid in America can grow up in a safe community.You can't have prosperity without security.This is the new civil rights agenda of our time. The right to a safe community, a quality education, and a secure job.Our campaign represents the long-awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.There is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly.The Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success.It is time to break-up that monopoly.I want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom – the civil right – to attend the school of their choice. This includes private schools, traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice.Our government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative – with billions left over. It's simply a matter of putting students first, not the education bureaucracy.Let's run through the numbers.At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year. That's an average of about $12,296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools.The federal government pays for about 10 percent—$64 billion, to be precise—of the K-12 costs. That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S. Department of Education.The other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states.We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. Yet, our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries.Our largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools.New York City spends $20,226 dollars per pupil.Baltimore spends $15,287 dollars per student.Chicago spends $11,976 dollars per student, and in Los Angeles it is $10,602.Just imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money – allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice.Not only would this empower families, but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes.These schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family – not the needs of the Teachers' Union. There is no more important job than a teacher, and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms.The current government monopoly, while great for the bureaucrats, has utterly failed too many students.According to the National Assessment of Education Progress, only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading.Failing schools then contribute to failing economies.In Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent. In Baltimore, it is 16.2 percent, 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City.In Los Angeles, 26 percent of African American women live in poverty. In Baltimore, the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent. In New York, over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty.Nationwide, nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty – including 45% of children under the age of six.Our public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success.Meanwhile, we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities – which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for America's children.Violent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015. Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%. There have been nearly 3,000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year.Government is failing our citizens at every level.That is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America.That means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public, private or religious school of their choice.Here is how it will work.Right now, about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide. These are opportunity scholarships, tax credits, and education savings accounts. This covers about 400,000 students in our country.Altogether, school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide.Charter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration.They also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone.My first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice. This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars.Specifically, my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty.We will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend. Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws, encouraging them to participate.This $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students.A state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds. Ohio is a leader in school choice. Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30,000 students, and 384 charter schools serving 123,844 students.But the $20 billion is only the beginning. As President, I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty.That means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public, private, charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family.Each state will develop its own formula, but we want the dollars to follow the student.9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level. To achieve this long-term goal, we will have to make this a shared national mission – to bring hope to every child in every city in this land.I will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states, and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city, state and federal level who support school choice.My Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America – Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit – that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 funds available per student.I am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore.If we can put a man on the moon, dig out the Panama Canal, and win two World Wars, then I have no doubt that we, as a nation, can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.If the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.The money will follow the student. That means the student will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice – and each state will develop its own system that works best for them.As your President, I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice. I understand many stale old politicians will resist. But it's time for our country to start thinking big once again. We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.I will also support merit-pay for teachers, so that we reward great teachers – instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones.At the same time, we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college.My policies will add millions of new jobs to our country, especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities.My plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year.By reducing radical regulation and over-taxation, we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities.Crucially, my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America. We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world – that's money coming straight out of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, and so many others. By ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices, we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America.The future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children.All we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past. We've had a failed foreign policy. A failed education policy. A failed economic policy. And, underneath it all, a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have – or how many journalists they know – not how many Americans they help to live better lives.But the failures of the past are about to end.Those failures end beginning on November 8th.We will have One American Nation.We will be One American People.We are fighting to give every child, in every forgotten stretch of this country, the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace.That means a safe neighborhood, a quality education, and a secure high-paying job.This is how we will rebuild our future.This is how We Will Make America Great Again – For Everyone.Thank you."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks to the 11th Annual Values Voter Summit in Washington, DC Omni Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C.","Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, Jon. Jon is such a great actor and such a great person. He is such a great person. And he's really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways. He's been incredible. So I just want to thank Jon. And I hope he makes another movie very quickly, because I love his movies. [laughter] In particular, I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership. [applause] And we know all about that. And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana, where two weeks ago I spent some time, and I saw some incredible, incredible people.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!MR. TRUMP: Thank you. [applause] Amazing, amazing group.One of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time I've spent with the evangelical community. And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible, I have to tell you. [applause] All across the nation. A lot of people said: I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals. I got the evangelicals. [cheers and applause] I'm going to make it up to you too, you watch. There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States. [applause] True. So true. I've witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land, gotten to know so many people. I saw it during my trip to Louisiana, where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need. Franklin Graham is an example. He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana. [cheers and applause] And he didn't want anything for it. He's a great man. It's that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country, which is in serious, serious trouble. [cheers and applause] Yet, our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith. And you understand that. All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in today's media environment.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right!MR. TRUMP: It is right, isn't it? [laughter] Yeah, it is right. [applause] Not even close. Your values of love, charity and faith built this nation. [cheers and applause] So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly? One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent. And Hillary Clinton, you can forget about her. [laughter and jeers]So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you've never seen before. [cheers and applause] Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty – remember, remember. [cheers and applause] I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit, Great Faith Ministries International. Stand up if you're member. That's good. That was a great – that was an amazing experience. [applause] And the bishop, what a great guy. In my remarks, I spoke about how African American church – and this is all across the country – for centuries have been the conscience of our nation. Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history, leading us all to a better future. Very true. Amazing. This was such an amazing experience. [applause] This is the power of faith. It's the power to heal. It's the power to unite. It's the power to make all of us live better lives – all of us. [cheers and applause]Our nation today is divided. Nobody likes to say it, but we're living in a very, very divided nation. It will be our faith in God and his teachings, in each other, that will lead us back to unity. [cheers and applause]Each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together, united in common purpose and in common values. So let's talk today about some of the things – and these are great things – that we can do together to create the American future for everybody, not just a certain group of people, but for everybody.The first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back. It's been taken away. [cheers and applause] The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits. If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status.All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings – [cheers and applause] – on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson amendment – [cheers and applause] – if I am elected your president, I promise. [cheers and applause] So important.Thank you. That's so important.And I must tell you from the heart, this started, a building of mine in Manhattan. I had 50 pastors in a big conference room. And we actually had 50 pastors, two rabbis, a couple of priests. We were all talking. And we were there for two hours. And at the end, it was a love-fest. We all agreed. It was like a love-fest.And I said to them – we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue – and I said to them I'd love your support. And I know when I can get support. I'm quite sophisticated. [laughter] And I know they wanted to give me their total support, 100 percent, just like I had in the primaries. And I said I really would like your support. And they didn't really know what I was talking about. And I said, what's going on here? They said, well, sir, we can't do that because we would be violating the laws. And I said, what's the punishment? Well, we could lose our tax-exempt status, which, of course, is a, you know, massive penalty.I said, tell me about this. And we sat down. They talked about it. When did it happen? 1954 or so. Lyndon Johnson was having problems – powerful guy. I actually, as just own way – you have to gain respect for what he was able to do. Can you imagine that this man single-handedly – he was having problems with churches. And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason. And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status.So we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk. And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty. And one of the pastors, who I knew very well – and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just – and magnificent hearts, much more importantly – they looked at me and they said, that's actually right. They have more power than we do. We're not allowed to express.And that's what I said. We have to start thinking about this. And I thought about it. And then we had a large group of pastors again. I said I have thought about it. If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment. We are going to do that. And it's not going to be hard. It's not going to be hard. [cheers and applause]When you – when you think, from the standpoint of political, you have more than men – let's say men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent. You're much more than 50 percent, added together. And I actually believe that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship – like our polls have been going in the last four weeks, a rocket ship, right? [cheers and applause] I really believe that, because you're great people. The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week, they've been stopped from talking and speaking by a law. And we're going to get rid of that law and it's going to get rid of – we're going to get rid of it so fast.And I'm so proud to say – honestly, I don't want to take credit, but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second. I am so proud – I was just telling this to Tony – to say that was my idea. I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven, so this is going to be very – [laughter] – the only way. [applause] So we're going to get rid of it, and we're going to let your great people speak, and you're going to see something happen that's going to be very, very good, OK? So important.I hope – which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th. You cannot – you didn't vote four years ago. You didn't vote.AUDIENCE MEMBER: I did.MR. TRUMP: You did? Well, you did. A few of you did. [laughter] Believe me, I know. I look at the stats. You didn't vote. But this time you really have – and this is your last chance. This is it. I mean, we'll never have this opportunity again. So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up – your family and your friends, and get out and vote, OK? November 8th. [cheers and applause] Thank you. [cheers and applause] And if you do, we're going to win by a lot. That's not going to even be a close election. And if you don't, could be a very unhappy November 8th.We're also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – [cheers and applause] – which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens. And the numbers are horrendous. Your premiums are going up by 50, 60, 70 percent. The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period – very, very long. It is a disaster. It's a disaster, and everybody knows it. And it's going to die of its own weight anyway, but we're going to get rid of it and we're going to replace it with some great, great alternatives – much better health care at a much lower price. [cheers and applause]Hillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care, which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America. That's what she wants. That's what she's aiming at. That's what Obama wanted. He didn't quite get there, but he got this, and you see how bad this has been.One of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice. [cheers and applause] And I can't possibly emphasize this enough. Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools. This education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more so than the African-American community – none. The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50, 60, 70 years, some cases over a hundred years – over a hundred years. Their policies and their politics, and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime.When she was running for the Senate in New York State, she said she was going to produce jobs, jobs, jobs in Upstate New York. It's a disaster. She's going to produce jobs, big thing – jobs, we're going to bring back jobs. Been a catastrophe. We've lost tens of thousands of jobs. She never did a thing. It was all talk, no action, just like what she's doing right now is all talk, no action. She'll talk and talk, and nothing will happen. Only bad will happen. But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York. She won because of them, and she produced absolutely nothing. Jobs left. It's today one of the worst, one of the most depressing places in this country. So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs. I know jobs. She doesn't know jobs. That I can tell you. [cheers and applause]I have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time – the right to a safe community, a great education and a secure job. [applause]And I say to African-American parents, I say to Hispanic American parents – and I say it with great respect – our inner cities are a disaster – crime, no jobs, education is the worst, in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad. I say, with great respect, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse. You choose Donald Trump, I'm going to fix the problem. You're going to have safety. [applause] You're going to have good education. We're going to get jobs, because we're going to bring our jobs back. Mexico's taking our jobs. So many other places, they're taking our jobs. What China's doing to us is horrible. We're going to have jobs. What do you have to lose? I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix it. [cheers and applause]School choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice. Competition – the schools the schools will get better and better and better. [cheers and applause]And that means a private school, a religious school, a charter school or a magnet school. School choice also means that parents can home-school their children. [cheers and applause] Hundred percent.Hillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally, totally, like a puppet, by special interests. Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools, leading to higher unemployment and more poverty. The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe.My plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children – [applause] – including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country, every single one of them. [cheers and applause] This proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs. [applause] However – that's good, right? [applause] However, because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level, I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs. [applause] If we do this, that would mean $12,000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America. What a difference this is going to make. The money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family. In so many ways, you're going to have choice. My administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city – anybody – anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program – and there will be a lot of them – to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 in funds available per student. As your president, I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice you've ever seen. [cheers and applause] This means a lot to me, because I know it can turn things around. Again, the education can't get worse. Commo Core – we're going to end it. [cheers and applause] We're bringing education local. I will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures. The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again, and I'm going to bring back jobs, and I'm going to bring back the great education. Don't be surprised – remember this, November 8th – don't be surprised, because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks, if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago. You see what's going on? [cheers and applause] They're starting – people are starting to hear about this. And they're saying, wow. Wow. They're liking it. And again, can't get any worse. It's going to get a lot better. But only if I do it. They can't do it. The Democrats, they have – what they've done is incredible. And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same – rigid. It'll never change. Remember, a hundred years, 70 years, 50 – it's not going to change. Not going to happen. Now, let's talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come, the United States Supreme Court. [cheers and applause] Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia. The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others. It could even be – I mean, we could end up with a total of five judges by one president. It would be record-setting. Probably be three. Could be four. Could even be five. And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster. One of the most important issues, frankly – other than maybe defense, because we're going to build up our military, it's so depleted. [cheers and applause] We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to protect your Second Amendment, so many things. But one of the most important – some people think it's actually the most important – is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court. You see what's happening right now? Essentially it's four and four. And you see what – how bad it is. We're going to pick great judges. I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people. And we are going to put truly great people. Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what we're looking for, OK? [cheers and applause]This will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly. That's what's going to happen. I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written. [cheers and applause] We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans. We're not going to have that. I've made public a list of judges, as I said, that will guide my selection process. Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list. And we brought it up. Let's see a list. You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well. [laughter] Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public. They'd be rejected. Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty – not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four. If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably – as you know it – you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye. And we don't want to see that.Another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security. Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test – its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state. [cheers and applause] Failed at everything. Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power. They were dying three years ago. The sanctions were choking them. They would have fallen. But Obama didn't support people that would have taken over, and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support.But you look at what's happened to Iran in such a short period of time. But remember the ransom payments. Remember, it was $400 million two weeks ago. But then they made a mistake. This is cash. Remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn't open a bank account. There was no way of sending it into a checking account. [laughter] All lies, just like Obamacare was a big lie, remember? You can use your plan. You can use your doctors – 27 times, right? Twenty-seven times. You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie. It's all a lie. It's all a big lie. It's a rigged system and it's a lie.And I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. The 400 million (dollars), for those that haven't been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – cash. And I actually said – they said, oh, that money's going to be used for terror. I said, no, they don't need it for terror. They've got 150 billion (dollars). That's in addition to the $150 billion that we're giving back. I said they don't need it. This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts. They're not going to use it for terror. They have plenty of money for terror.Think of it – $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – massive, big vats of cash. You saw them – cartons. I never saw anything like it. I've seen a lot of cash. [laughter] Hey, never saw anything like this – $1.7 billion (dollars). Can you imagine these guys? Planes get – they stop. Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages. They waited there for hours and hours. And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do – even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something. It was this – just another lie.But can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai, yai, yai. They think we're stupid. [laughter] They think we're stupid. They won't be thinking it for long. [cheers and applause] Very sad. [cheers and applause]At the same time, ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross. ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East. We cannot let this evil continue – can 't let it. [cheers and applause] ISIS must be destroyed – have to; have no choice.To defeat ISIS, we must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare. It's a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago – different world.We must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism – [cheers and applause] – words that our president won't use and words that Hillary Clinton won't use. Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy, so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism.By the way, President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more. But it's almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria. They take others, but they don't take Christians – very, very, very rare.So I said that we need to make safe zones in the region. We want to take care of people. But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue, and we have to stop this. This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country. It's from within. This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. This could be it.You ever notice on the – you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones. Cellphones. And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them. And some of them have things far worse than that – scenes far worse than that.So it was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place. If they did the right thing, you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now. [applause] Now she wants to get rid of – oh, we're going to get rid of them. You know, she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground. Now, even if you don't want boots on the ground, you don't want to say it. Don't say it! Now they're saying, oh, I hope she wins. Oh, boy, would they dream of having her as president. Can you – [laughter] – they dream about it every night, having Hillary Clinton. But even if you believe – and I can understand that. No boots on the ground, I can understand. You don't say it! Let them think they're going to go through hell. Don't say it! [cheers and applause]Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine the great General George Patton, or one of our great generals that we have today – General Flynn, who's here someplace – [cheers and applause] – I love General Flynn – but can you imagine these people saying – I mean, they're basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground. If you don't want that, I fully understand. Don't say it! Don't say it! Could you imagine MacArthur saying we're going to fight the enemy, and we're going to move our troops in in about a month, we're going to hit from behind? [laughter] We're going to hit them from the front, then – and everything they say turns out to be true? You know, I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room, but maybe we shouldn't be so honest when it comes to military strategy. Does that make sense? [laughter and applause] Hope I didn't lose your vote for saying that. [applause]Just look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq, Syria and Libya. The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She really is. She's trigger-happy, and yet she says no boots, which is sort of – probably will be boots, you know. Probably will turn out to be another disaster. He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death. She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change with people we don't even know who they are. And they take over, and they're far worse. This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS.My administration, on the other hand, will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And by the way, that includes Russia. If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I'm concerned. [cheers and applause] It's a very imperfect world, and you can't always choose your friends. That's life.But you can never fail to recognize your enemies. We have some real enemies. Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails. These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena. What's that? Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never, ever see them. She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them, and many were destroyed with a hammer. [laughter] Did anybody ever hit a hammer – you know, maybe two or three people, but they were just released from prison, those two people. [laughter] Can you believe this? Destroyed them with a hammer – the old-fashioned way, I guess. [laughter] The other night in the Commander in Chief Forum – did anybody see that? [cheers and applause] How did I do? [cheers] Good. Well, we have a big debate coming up. Who knows what's going to happen there? But I will say, every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief. [cheers and applause] We had – the polls came out after that event and we won big league. Now we have a debate coming up. I don't imagine any of you going to be watching the debate, right? [laughter and cheers]AUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't take her bait. Don't take her bait.MR. TRUMP: I won't; I promise. Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly. That's why she lost. That's why she did so poorly. She was terrible. She was – honestly, I shouldn't be saying this – she was terrible. [laughter] She keeps talking about the emails. Every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently. [laughter] It seems each week, true, she has, like, a different answer. But there can be no answer when she deletes 33,000 emails, bleaches them so they can never be recovered – an unheard-of practice – hammers them into total silence. You know what happening. You know what's happening.I always say, getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career. [laughter and cheers] It's true. It's true. [cheers and applause] So her answers were bad. They were bad. And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest. And you know, she was blaming Matt Lauer. I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job. I mean, his questions to me were very tough. [applause] But the gentleman who stood up and said: Honestly, you should be in prison for what you did – [jeers] – to me, that was the tough one. [laughter] That was the tough – hey, that was a tough question. [laughter] It was sort of a question in the form of a statement, right? [laughter]Hillary Clinton is unfit to be our president, for many reasons. [cheers and applause] True. True. [cheers and applause] She's unfit for many reasons, the biggest of which is her judgement. It's just so bad. [laughter] It's time to restore honestly and integrity to our government. [applause] Have to do it. And one more issue, finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy, and helping those in need. There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians. [applause] And all of us through – and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty. Going to do it, with a lot of other people going to help. As you president, I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country – millions of new jobs. [cheers and applause] We've lost our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. They've gone to other countries. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to many other countries. China's taking massive advantage of us. It's all so easy, believe me. It's all so easy.That includes, we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses. [cheers and applause] It includes, very importantly, the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations. [cheers and applause] It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy, which is under siege. [cheers and applause] I will also renegotiate NAFTA. And if they don't want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway, not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs, we will terminate NAFTA, believe me. [cheers and applause] We'll stand up to China, and we're going to fight for every last job. It's going to be America first, and it's going to be the American worker first. [cheers and applause]Crucially, I will also fight for the American family and American family values. The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda. Has to be. [cheers and applause] Thank you.Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly. Great woman, really great woman. [applause] We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis. [cheers and applause]Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America. She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or to politicians. The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God. Phyllis understood that. [cheers and applause] Phyllis understood that.And by the way, Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago, when it wasn't necessarily – [cheers] – something that was so easy to do. And she was incredible. She was so brave. She endorsed me, and that was not the thing to do at the time. People said, Trump? She said, he's going to win, you don't understand. He knows how to win. He's going to win. [applause] They said, Phyllis, not going to be Trump. And we went boom, boom, boom. But I will tell you, Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasn't necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that. That had a huge impact. She was a great, great, powerful woman with a tremendous heart. And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow, because you really – that's a celebration. She was 92 years old. [cheers and applause]We are all equal, and we all come from the same Creator. If we remember that simple fact, then our future is truly limitless. There is nothing we as Americans can't do.There's a biblical verse that I have often read, and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what we're trying to achieve right now for our country. It's from 1 John, Chapter 4: ""No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us.""AUDIENCE MEMBER: Amen.MR. TRUMP: So true. [cheers and applause] So true. [applause]Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag. [cheers and applause] It's time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country.Thi"
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks to the 11th Annual Values Voter Summit in Washington, DC Omni Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C.","is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017, we will be one American nation. It's time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future. Have to do it. Together, we will make America believe again, we will make America united again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, and God bless you. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]"
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at a Rally at the Pensacola Bay Center in Pensacola, Florida","It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home. Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans.Let me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.The citizens of this country will be in charge once more.The special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing.The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.This will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.Change is coming.All the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.It's your turn now. This is your time.The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change – not partisan change.We are fighting for all Americans – Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals – who've been failed by this corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.We're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.Ours is the campaign of the future.In this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first – and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership – are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over.We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.In this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.My tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years.The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton – much of it to her personal bank account – to keep you from having the future you deserve.But on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.In this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.In this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career.To keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength.That means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.One more massive Hillary Clinton failure.Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder.She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too – without any plan for the day after.She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia –while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.Let's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch.Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength – not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world – so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing.I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn.America will get the respect it deserves.And if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.On these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace – for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future.Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.Her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change – but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.She lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.By the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.Hillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.Throughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.The insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.All the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win – and how to avoid endless war.Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.We will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States – not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.And we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism.The fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape.Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.We will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.We simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now.That applies to everything.Change is needed at every single level of our society.When I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.I want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.The possibilities for our future are unlimited.The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.If we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist – now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.When I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone – but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.We are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.New schools, new factories, new infrastructure.Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.Most importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.Here, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans – from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.These incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion.All working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.In particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.I've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine.My campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.This is our chance. It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again.Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation.Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice – and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition.Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world. You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com.Massive tax reductions and tax simplification – so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time.Most importantly, 2017 will be about unity.Once again, we will be One American Nation.We Will Be One American People.Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans.We will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.Friends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!"
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at the US Cellular Center in Asheville, North Carolina","This is our chance – our one chance – to fix our rigged system and create prosperity for each and every American.Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate.Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas.By contrast, I've been going around the country offering detailed plans for reform.All of these reform plans are available on our website.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.You are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders. You are Democrats, Independents and Republicans.Above all else, you are Americans – and you are entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you and defends you.Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country.Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House.Hillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors and the special interests.I will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute, but first let me invite onto the stage some people who can tell you themselves what they think of her spiteful comments.I have some more thoughts on Clinton's remarks I will be sharing momentarily, but first I want to tell you what I am going to do to make your life better.We've outlined a detailed plan on trade, on immigration, on rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy.I've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism, on reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy, and on providing school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.We've released policy after policy, solution after solution.Every day, we are putting forward new ideas to make your life better.The change will start right away, the moment I take my oath of office.On my first day, we are going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama.Then, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restriction on American energy – this will create another half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.On my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.I am also going to propose a massive tax reduction to unleash prosperity in every city and state in our country.On that first day, I am also going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing. I will use every lawful Presidential power to achieve relief for our workers.You can read the full 7-point trade plan on my website, DonaldJTrump.com.North Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed it, and Hillary Clinton supported it.Right here in Ashville, you've lost 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization – another Hillary-backed deal.Hillary Clinton owes all of you an apology. And I think you'll get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton hands over the 33,000 emails she deleted.By the way, Hillary Clinton destroyed her emails after she received a congressional subpoena. They used a special software called bleach bit.She even made her 13 different phones disappear – some of them were even destroyed with a hammer.Hillary Clinton obviously had a whole lot to hide, including her pay-for-play scandals at Secretary of State.Pay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and family in Haiti.Nothing is so dangerous to American Democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale.Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law.She also believes that she is above all of you.After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country.She said tens of millions of patriotic Americans belong in a ""basket of deplorables."" She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings.She said half of our supporters are not even real Americans, and describes the other half as having run out of options – what she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through the lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment. They want change, they want justice, and they want a government that puts the American people first.Whether our supporters have lost a job to a factory moved to another country, or whether they're a captain in the police department, or a teacher at a local school, they are united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people.For those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country.Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working class Americans. She looks down on them – she looks down on all the people who make her life possible. She looks down on the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, lawyers and accountants. She looks down on the police officers, soldiers, and firefighters supporting our campaign.She looks down on the people who cook her meals, drive her cars, and dig the coal that powers her electricity.She called these Americans every name in the book – racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic – she said they were not even American.Never in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter.She was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans.What should these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks?To every kid in America tonight, I want you to know: your parents are working so hard to make your life better, and to make your country better – and if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside them to deliver a better future for everyone.Clinton made her remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street. Her goal is simple: to bully the American voter out of voting for change.The people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are. They want to keep our terrible trade deals. They want to trap children in failing government schools. They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete.Hillary Clinton can never be President of this country. No one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their President.Earlier today I had a chance to spend some time with some more of our most amazing Americans.I spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States.These are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters, and who fight our wars.These heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation.We also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.There is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and its people.Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.One thing that we must do is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment, resources and tools in the world.We must provide them the best medical care while they serve, and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life.The Veterans scandals that have occurred under this Administration – and that have been dismissed by my opponent – are a permanent stain on this government. It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself.We must take care of our Veterans. That includes giving Veterans the right to choose treatment at either a public VA facility, or the private doctor of their choice.Just today we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its performance records available to consumers.The scandals never seem to end – but they will, when I'm elected President.Nothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who hear the uniform.We've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals, these are the people who know how to keep our country safe.Just today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients. I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have the support of these intrepid heroes.Also, today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, is now a senior advisor to our campaign.We are on a mission of change.That includes a new agenda for our inner cities.The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.For those suffering and hurting, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. I will fix it. What do you have to lose?Let me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of new jobs, higher wages, and amazing schools.I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans – and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.We will keep our children safe – which includes steadfast support for American law enforcement.Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Government corruption will end.Honesty will be restored.Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America prosperous again.We will make America safe again.And will Make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
Donald Trump,2016,"Address to the National Guard Association of the United States 138th General Conference & Exhibition at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, Maryland","Thank you. I am honored to be here today. Let me extend my special gratitude to General Ashenhurst and General Hargett, and to each and every one of you.The National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home, and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people.Our debt to you is eternal.Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City.Since 9/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas – including those with multiple deployments. Right now, 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries across the world.Members of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country.If I am given the honor to serve as your President, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve.You will have a true and loyal friend in the White House.Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. I will not let you down.I am running to be a President for all Americans – and I've been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform.All across this country, I've met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community. There's nothing I've enjoyed more than the time I've spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics.They embody the goodness and decency of our country.I was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear and demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future.These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized. These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American. She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book – she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic.She called them a ""basket of deplorables"" in both a speech and an interview. She divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings.Hillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street.She and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh. They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on, paint the buildings she speaks in, and keep the lights on in her auditorium.Hillary Clinton is an insider, supported by powerful insiders, attacking Americans who have no political power.Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run.She spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their families.While Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts.She revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her Foundation.It's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria and in Libya.To this day, she still won't take accountability for her role in unleashing ISIS across the Middle East – or for putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law, that she is above accountability, and that she is above each and every one of you.Our campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless. It's about representing the forgotten men and women of this country.I'm here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness.I am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless. I'm running to take on the special interests, the big donors, and the corrupt political insiders.I am running to be your voice.Hillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for the top tenth of the one percent. Just look at the people funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and paying for her speeches, and you'll know who she represents.The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service.You cannot run for President if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter. You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.Hillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered. In fact, she hasn't backed down at all – she's doubled-down on her campaign of conspiracy and contempt.If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, then I don't see how she can credibly campaign.Let's be clear. These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton. These were not stray remarks in an interview, or an accidental choice of words. These were lengthy, planned, and prepared remarks – it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major-party presidential nominee.Clinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic Playbook – smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change. She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people.She used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform.People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.Hillary Clinton doesn't have to worry about Sanctuary Cities, or jobs moving overseas. She's protected from her own policies.The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes, and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.Our campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans.We are the campaign of school choice.We are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker.We are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by and for the people.This change agenda includes a new foreign and military policy.We are going to put the failed policies of the past behind us.We will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do – and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS.Instead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory.We will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent, and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States.My plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military, and the elimination of the defense sequester. In this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best, modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world.The National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people.You are there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike.You are there to protect civilians in times of unrest.You are there to respond to every natural disaster.You deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution, and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done.In a Trump Administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office.You will have an Administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day.You will have a President who supports, promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every turn.The members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety and our country.We will never forget our heroes, their families, and the ones they've left behind.Our gratitude is everlasting.We will protect those who protect us.And we will follow your example of unity – working in common purpose and common cause.We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.We will rebuild our military – and our country.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless you all."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at Aston Community Center in Aston, Pennsylvania","Thank you. I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country. She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today.I want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues.We are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.Our campaign is about ideas. We're about solutions. I've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.I've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.Right now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things. I'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.We must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.We have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people. Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power.Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.That means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids.We want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone.These solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force. Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.For many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense – even more than housing.Yet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area – and my opponent has no childcare plan.Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster – a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home. There is no financial security.But that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight. Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.The first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America – including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians – to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.They will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13.Because of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.The deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.Importantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributionsto their families and to our society. Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.For low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax – a major relief for low-income parents. This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.Next, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account. Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free. Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans – you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them.Immediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.The money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities. Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year – they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury. Instead, the funds rollover – so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.These savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reformsI outlined last week.The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18. Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.For low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds – if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match. To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.These Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.Our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions. The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.But to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities. We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.In this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button – including services like nanny-sharing. Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.Our plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well. This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time. Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services. Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.Finally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave. This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing. By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit. This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.There are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.On Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings. Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.These are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President. It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together – not as Republicans or Democrats – but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, loveyour families, and want a better future for all Americans.It's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people.It's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.It is time to Believe In America.Together, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.We Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.And Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at Seven Flags Event Center in Des Moines, Iowa","Thank you. It is so great to be back in Iowa. Spending time in your state has been one of the great joys of this campaign.Together, we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House, and Make America Great Again.The White House will become the People's House. We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years.We are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, free children from failing government schools, eliminate government waste, and create a fair, simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs.Prosperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will finally begin to grow – and they will grow rapidly.This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people.In recent days, we've rolled out one new policy idea after another – on taxes, on school choice, on foreign policy, on defeating terrorism, on rebuilding our military, on Veterans care, on unleashing American energy, and on the vital issue of trade.By contrast, Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions, only hatred and derision.I am running to be a President for all Americans – Democrat, Republican, Independent, everyone. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.It's this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear – including with a hammer – so the FBI couldn't see them, and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena. Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today.Anyone watching today's hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined.This is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was, but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs – here we don't have either. This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation.Whether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, temperament and moral character to lead this country.In the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office: ""she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.""The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas, and produced only failing schools, rising crime, job loss, shrinking incomes, and tragic poverty at home.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years.I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.That includes our family farms right here in Iowa.Family farms are the backbone of this country. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms.We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, corn-based ethanol, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief.Our plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death – helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.That means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers, help them export their goods, and grow family farming in America.My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy – which means lower electricity prices for our farmers, and half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.By the way, remember when Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, said the ""lack of transparency,"" was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about – and I quote – ""the stupidity of the American voter."" This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr. Gruber and Hillary Clinton – and the voters have had enough. They're taking their country back.Another major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.It's time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.Our policies on taxes, trade, regulations and education will grow incomes, boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities.We need a new civil rights agenda for our time, one that promises safe neighborhoods, great education, and secure jobs.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.Over 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year. There's a shooting on average every 2 hours.To those suffering and hurting I say: what do you have to lose – vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it. I will bring back millions of jobs, higher wages, and great schools.I will make your communities safe.Safety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism.New video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse. The victims were dragged, then hung from meathooks, and then their throats were slit.This is an evil, sadistic, monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country.We know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows, and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country.My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs.I support the construction of safe zones in the region, and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it.At the same time, as we rebuild our military, we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share. Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense. I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden – and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism.In all things, it's time to put Americans first – and start taking care of each other.Tonight, I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment. I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA – which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States – not in China, and all over the world.We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again – like never before.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at a Rally at Canton Memorial Civic Center in Canton, Ohio","Thank you, Ohio. It is so great to be in the great city of Canton.We just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN. We're up five points in Ohio, and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide.The people of the United States are ready for change. They're ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains, disrespects and looks down on hardworking people.This election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C. versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens.For years, our leaders have looked out only for themselves.There is no greater example of this in our country than Flint, Michigan. The city of Flint was once known as Buick City. More than 80,000 workers were employed by GM in 1970 – today, its less than 8,000. Forty percent of the city's residents are living in poverty. Violent crime is among the nation's highest.Today I went to Flint, Michigan to address the water crisis. The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government.It's tragic and it's heartbreaking, and it should never happen in the United States of America.This is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own.It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn this around. We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people.Driving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses, the dilapidated infrastructure.This is what our politicians have done to this city, this is what our politicians have done to America.But nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities. Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years. Their policies have produced massive poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.They've trapped Americans in suffering for years, and I'm running to offer a better future. Lower crime, better schools, more jobs – safety, security, opportunity.Now, I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who aren't planning on voting for me right now. I will campaign hard for their votes – we can't stay the course our country is on. If you keep voting for the same people, you'll keep getting the same results.I am willing to campaign anywhere. I am willing to go anywhere, visit anywhere, even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support.Hillary Clinton calls people who aren't supporting her deplorable and irredeemable. I call people who aren't supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else – and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote, in every last American community, right up until November 8th.I will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat, or that have voted Democrat for generations. I am running to be President for all Americans, to represent all Americans, and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence.The economic policies of Hillary Clinton – on trade, on the economy, on immigration – have devastated the inner cities of America. Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution.Hillary Clinton believes in globalism – taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the world – I am running to be President of the United States. I am running to bring hope to Flint, to Canton, and to every party of this country.If we don't break free from our partisan boxes, then nothing will ever change – it's time to vote for America and America First.Hillary Clinton's refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term. That's enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States.President Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions, bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just one single year.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees, we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black, white and Latino. You are moms and dads, children and grandparents, you are from cities small and large and in-between. But above everything else, you are all Americans.Hillary Clinton's attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress.There is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale. Look at what she did with Russian Uranium, or with UBS bank, or with the contracts in Haiti.Hillary Clinton's record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure. Just look at what she did to the Middle East – in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. Not to mention her failures in Russia, China and North Korea.One failure after another – all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street.The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled.I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.That begins with a new America-First trade policy.Hillary Clinton's bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clinton's NAFTA, her support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and her support for the TPP – she called it the ""Gold Standard.""Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO.Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.I will renegotiate NAFTA, I will defend your jobs, and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America.America's trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved – which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance.We won't let that happen. But you have to get out and vote.My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.I will fight for you against the special interests, against the corrupt politicians, and against the powerful insiders. Let me be your champion.In all things, it's time to put Americans first – and start taking care of each other.Yesterday, I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans.I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment [NRA endorsement]; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA – which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States – not in China, and all over the world.We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again – like never before.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. We will rebuild our water infrastructure, and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission: clean air and safe water.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
Donald Trump,2016,Remarks to the Economic Club of New York at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City,"Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.Today, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival – it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.Look no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM – today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn this around.My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.Jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.All of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism – which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country – and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.Under this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.My opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution – a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.In Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.Not one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.In the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.Politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable – how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?The hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos – but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.These are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice.I am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.I'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States – and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.We are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.It's time to start thinking big once again.That's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.In working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math.This growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.It will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.Right now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter – that translates to millions of lost jobs.This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.Over the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.Perhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt – it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.Now, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.Instead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.Never has so much money been spent so poorly.But we're going to turn that all around. Here's how.It begins with bold new tax reform.As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all – in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit – it won't even be close.This is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.Parents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit – in the form a Childcare rebate – and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate – down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch.We will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.We will turn America into a magnet for new jobs – and that means jobs in our poorest communities.Next, comes regulations.One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry – and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.I've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.We're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.Energy reform is central to our plan as wellAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.Hillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will:increase GDP by more than $100 billion annuallyadd over 500,000 new jobs annuallyincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 yearsincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decadesincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process.Finally, comes trade – the foundation for everythingAmerica's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year – an enormous drag on growth.Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.It is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted – every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.Our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps:I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators – and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.We are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Next, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.Here is how the plan adds upWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan.Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.That leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade – again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.This is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.This is what our new future will look likeI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA – and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at a Rally at the James L. Knight Center in Miami, Florida","Thank you. It is so great to be in my second home, Florida, and in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and employees.New polls have just come in, and we're leading in battleground states all over this country – including four points here in Florida. LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide.Come November 8th, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for the people – it's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the Veterans, the everyday citizens.And it's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason for hope in a long time.I'm campaigning in every community, and every part of this country, for every last vote. I am running to be a President for all Americans.I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes. What incredible people.Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life. You are cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic – but above all else, you are American.Just today, I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders. We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals.We also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol Officers – as well as law enforcement officers across the country.And we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country.Clinton's campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists. It's the oldest play in the Democratic play book – and Americans have had enough.They want solutions, and they want better lives – not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians.People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.Yet, while she lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors, she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.It's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world. It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS.Her policies have created disaster overseas, and poverty at home. I am running to reverse these failures, and create a New American future.That future begins with prosperity at home.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities. African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.Democrats have run these inner cities for half a century. They control the mayors' offices, the school boards, the city councils, and the seats in Congress – and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime, and more failing schools.45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty. More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone. 58% of African-American youth are not working.These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, and everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering.Hillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years – her disastrous record speaks for itself.The only people she delivers for is her donors.I am going to deliver for you, the American people.If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.My first day in office, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy – which means at least another half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.I am also going to completely reform our trade deals. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and keep America out of the TPP. We don't need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down.Another major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty. This is unacceptable. To the Hispanic community I say: we are going to protect your jobs, we are going to build up your schools, and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.Earlier this week, I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.We are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression.The President's one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime. But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order, which means the next President can reverse them – and that is what I will do, unless the Castro Regime meets our demands. Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.Let's also talk about Venezuela.Venezuela is a beautiful, vibrant, and resource-rich country, filled with amazing and hardworking people. But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists.The next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free.Here, in America, I will push to expand freedom for all of our people.I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at the Remembrance Project Luncheon at the Omni Houston Hotel at Westside in Houston, Texas","Thanks, Maria, for that introduction, and for the work you and your organization do to honor these stolen American lives – and to advocate for justice on behalf of all American victims.I am honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced into the shadows. Your stories are not featured in the news, you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf, you have no special interests taking up your cause, and politicians ignore your cries for help. But I never will.I have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign. But nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I've spent with the families of the Remembrance Project, and the incredible strength and courage you've shown in your often lonely fight for justice.You are heroes. And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters or parents.The most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives. Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office.Every day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized. Every day Sanctuary Cities are left in place, innocent Americans are put in harm's way. Every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child.It's happening every single day.All across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table, because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the laws.There are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate. But let me give you the most important number of all. That most important number of all is the number of American lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration. Let me tell you what that number is: ZERO.Our nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws. What do you tell to the mother, who just buried her daughter, because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home?What do you tell to the young boy, who will grow up without a dad, because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the country?What do you tell the wife, who has lost her husband, because a Sanctuary City released an illegal immigrant from behind bars?This must end. And it must end right now. Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders.Just look at what's happened in the last few days.Last week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a three-year period.Earlier this week, in Kansas, a Sheriff's Department Master Deputy was killed, apparently by an illegal immigrant. The driver was previously arrested for a DUI in California in 2001 and for a traffic violation in Kansas in 2013. Deputy Collins was killed only hours after his daughter's fourth birthday.A few days ago, two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa. This individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported – but his home country refused to take him back, so he was simply released. One of the victims has six children, is an Air Force Veteran, and a high school football coach – the other victim is a mother and a grandmother.When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton's desk. But she failed to take forceful action, and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don't take back their citizens.According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Most of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch – she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.Now, my opponent will never meet with you. She will never hear your stories. She will never share in your pain.She will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates.Her plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days, which means Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants. Her plan calls for catch-and-release on the border. Sanctuary Cities. Ignoring visa overstays. Closing detention centers. And a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America.Hillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order – violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril.Hillary Clinton is the first person to ever run for the Presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that country.But the media doesn't want you to know any of that. So they'll never ask her any questions about her plan. Like how she'll afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants, or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody – or at the border. She's not asked to explain what she'll say to the American workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law.Your cause, and your stories, are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost. To them, your presence is just too inconvenient.But help is coming. On November 8th, we are going to win the White House and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every American victim.Together, we will save American lives – and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room today.Since 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities – these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation.According to the federal government's own data, there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the United States right now. However, this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice, fled the jurisdiction, or were otherwise never caught. Many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases.At the same time, hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism. We are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believe.Whether it's drugs, terrorism or violent crime, our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country. The Border Patrol Agents, who endorsed me, warned that Hillary Clinton's plan would put the entire country in grave danger – they called it radical, deeply dangerous, and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis.Let's just remember our goal – to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate.That is what is at stake in this election.So I am now going to invite some of the bravest people I know to come up to the stage and speak.[INVITE FAMILIES TO SPEAK]These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer.I am here standing with you. The American people are here standing with you. And come November, your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive."
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at High Point University in High Point, North Carolina","Thank you. It's wonderful to be back in North Carolina.Come November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to bring back your jobs.We are going to cut your taxes.We are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals.And we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism.Over the weekend, there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City, and in New Jersey. These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country.Attack after attack – from 9/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando – we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger.So let me state this very clearly: immigration security is national security.My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency. As Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back.Now Obama wants to bring in an additional 110,000 refugees, and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term – with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.This isn't just a matter of terrorism, but also quality of life. We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country.My highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day – and I will never waver in that sacred obligation.It's just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering. Since 9/11, hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States.Now we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders. This is unacceptable.Altogether, there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed.In the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism.Now we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.Yet, my opponent won't even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism. In fact, Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists. She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign – many of them cops and soldiers – deplorable and irredeemable. Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam, or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas? Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? In many countries overseas, non-believers face the death penalty – where is Hillary's condemnation here?Let's ask Hillary Clinton: how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views, and support the oppression of non-believers, would you call deplorable or irredeemable – or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump?America can never elect a President, like Hillary Clinton, who apparently, with her choice of words, thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists.Anyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President.The commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction. Our system of government is the best in the world and, as your President, I will defend our values – and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way.It's also time to remember one very important word: accountability. All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clinton's watch.Her policies in Iraq, Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS. Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us.Her timetable withdrawal from Iraq, her push for regime change in Libya and Syria, her open borders policies – these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster.So she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure.Her claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool, demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying.When she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides ""aid and comfort,"" to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office. Her comments are not only reckless, but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks.ISIS is torturing, murdering, executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide. And what is Hillary Clinton's suggestion? That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers. I have news for Hillary Clinton: refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger, it will only increase and embolden the danger – just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State.The rise of ISIS is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.Secretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes, displace millions, and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country. How is this a smart policy?Hillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today – and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores.We must stop the massive inflow of refugees – which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase. We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur.Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion – such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith– are commonplace.It is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here, and to become part of our incredible home. Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule, and it's one more reason why she can never be President.It's time to break with the corruption, the bad judgement, and the failures of the past.It is time to have a new American Future.We are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values.We are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas, and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism. This will not only require military warfare, but also financial warfare, cyber warfare, and ideological warfare.But to win this struggle, we need to be strong at home.We are going to rebuild our country.And at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year.The schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty.To the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it – I will bring back your jobs, I will fix your schools, and I will fight for you as no one ever has before.It is time for a new civil rights agenda, one that promises safe communities, great education, and good-paying jobs.My whole life has been about creating jobs. Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs – just look at upstate New York, and her terrible trade deals.Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through.The South Korean deal was supposed to create 70,000 jobs – instead, we lost 100,000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled.Next, Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Your state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal – and if we don't get the deal we want, I will walk away.Our trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year – this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton.But we are going to turn it all around.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to create American energy independence; I'm going to make our government lean, responsible and efficient; I'm going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States;We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
Donald Trump,2016,"Remarks at a Rally at Sun Center Studios in Chester Township, Pennsylvania","Thank you. It's wonderful to be here in Pennsylvania.Great polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.At the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American: safety.We are going to Make America Safe Again.The rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens. It must be ended.The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace.Who is looking out for them?For every one violent disruptor, there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school.To all our citizens, in all of our inner cities, and all across the country, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you and I will fight for you.The job of a leader is to stand in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective. Hillary Clinton calls people who don't support her deplorable, and irredeemable. I call anyone who doesn't support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law.I will be a President for all Americans, and I will campaign for every last vote, in every last community.I will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens.But to do this, we must work with our police – not against our police.Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least.Low-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives.65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday.The problem is not that there are too many police. The problem is that there are not enough police.Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from chaos.Hillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night. No, it's the poor family living in the inner city – it's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country.Who is there to represent these families?Hillary Clinton doesn't want to hear their voices. So I will be their voice, and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country. People who just want a secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and a good-paying job to support their loved ones.We will bring security to our African-American communities, and to our Latino communities. We will also bring school choice, and new prosperity.Democrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century. It's time for change – it's time for a New American Future.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been ""fighting for women."" That she has been ""fighting for children."" Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, ""Watch what I do, not what I say.""At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.And just last week here in Pennsylvania, I was joined by my daughter, Ivanka, and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.We have also talked about improving education, and I will talk about it more tonight. A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege. The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish. Education is the bedrock of our society.Women also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders. As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.This must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.The changes will start immediately.On my first day in office, I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses.This will unleash a technology revolution. America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future. The next great American invention, the next great improvement to our lives, is right around the corner. All we have to do is remove the red tape.Our plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history. It's going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country a magnet for new jobs.We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution. Oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables. This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year.But to be a prosperous nation, we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country.That is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors. We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses.Steel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way.Your state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton.The Clintons robbed Pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them to other countries – we are going to bring them back.Jobs will come flowing back in all over America.It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We're going to turn it all around.There's a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign – and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you – visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement.Let me tell you what else we're going to do.One of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education. The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973.But what a lot of people don't know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments. These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt.Instead, these universities use the money to pay their administrators, or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money away. In fact, many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs.But they should be using the money on the students – for tuition, for student life, and for student housing.On top of that, the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year, plus another $130 billion on federal loans.Here again, the universities don't use the money to reduce the price of college – but to increase it.We have to break this cycle. I'm going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars – paid for by you – that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt, and to spend their endowments on their own students.Another major issue for all American families is healthcare. President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2,500 dollars. Instead, the opposite happened – the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5,000 dollars during that time.Just one more Washington lie – like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.It's a disaster.That is why, on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.We are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first. These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts, empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines, and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare.Her plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, by making them citizens – bankrupting these programs for Americans.She doesn't understand how Democracy works. Public servants are just that – they're there to serve you. But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America – and America First.Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.Government will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity – where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.That's what I want to do for our country – I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses – I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be – all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers – and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.It's that spirit of strength we will need to start winning again as a country.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.You have 46 days to change the world. You have 46 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution of the United States; close our border to terrorists, save the 2nd amendment; and put American workers first.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
